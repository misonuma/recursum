Service was good but server was new and seemed a little nervous and it was understandable since we were a party of 10. Food was great. I had stuffed Manicotti and would get it again!! ,"  Came in for Mother's Day with a large party. They let us make a reservation the day before. Service was great, the food was even better. Everyone left fat and happy. Love this place!

We will definitely be visiting again ," The Steak 'N Blue and Chopped Gorgonzola salads are yummy!! My husband and I have been coming here for years and have never had a terrible experience. Cameron is our favorite waiter but they are all great! By the way, the bread is always fresh and 100 times more flavorful than Olive Garden's bread sticks. ","  Nice atmosphere with friendly staff. 
Clean and open floor plan. 
The roasted Brussel and Beet salad was fantastic, the Anna's lasagna was a bit salty but had a nice sauce. 
House cabernet was tasty, overall a nice experience.  ", This place is my favorite!! I would eat here everyday if I could! Lol love love love it!!! ,"  It's ok. Floor was dirty and our waiter seemed almost clueless. Food was good but not ""write home about""  ","  I had the pasta rustico which tasted like straight up tomato sauce out of a can, could have used any kind of seasoning, very bland. The fresh bread is excellent. My boyfriend had the mac n cheese which he loved but I was not very happy with my pasta.",If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant in the Surprise AZ area this is the place to visit. The staff here is very warm and friendly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal!,"It's worth the money.

Coffee was not good - especially with so many good coffee options in the Strip. ,"  Brisket Hash is one of the best things to get anywhere for brunch in Pittsburgh.

Great options and great food.  ","  Cafe Raymond is my ""go to"" breakfast spot. I know I can depend on them for great food and good service.

The omelettes are excellent, so are their pan fried potatoes. 

I like ordering at the cashier station, and then finding a table, the food seems to arrive faster that way. 

This is a great spot to breakfast with friends.  "," We planned to go to another very popular breakfast spot and there was quite a wait so we choose Raymonds as a 2nd choice. Got right in, and their breakfast was AWESOME! Service was great. All the food is cooked by Raymond-homemade sauces, breads, local meats. Can't say enough. We will be back! Do not discount it for lesser reviews than some other places on Yelp. It will not disappoint! ","  Cafe Raymond in the Strip is my favorite place to go for breakfast or lunch. I have never been disappointed in the food or the service. The signature ricotta blueberry pancakes are superb. I also love the vegetarian muffaletta sandwich. It's the best I've ever had. I've taken friends from New York City, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco to eat at Cafe Raymond's and they were all impressed with the food, the personnel and the atmosphere. I recommend Cafe Raymond as the best place to eat in the Strip!  ","  This is as good as it gets. Showed up on Easter Sunday for breakfast. Coffee, feta spinach quiche /w deliciously seasoned potato wedges, hame and brie sandwich on italian bread. Oh, and one more thing, ricotta blueberry pancakes... The quiche crust has a sweetness, so if you're into savory / sweet combos. The quality of eggs and spinach used is up there. The ricotta pancakes were so good, I think its in the batter, who knows ? I've got a breakfast spot in Pittsburgh :=)  ","  This place was a nice find on the strip. We ducked in not expecting much, but ended up having a delicious breakfast for a reasonable price. I had the special, which consisted of fried eggs atop a bbq beef hash. The bbq was flavorful, with a spicy kick at the end that had me finishing my plate in record time. The coffee was also pretty good, and the free refills were a nice added bonus. I'm looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in Pittsburgh, and seeing what else their menu has to offer!  ", Had lunch here a few weeks back and I have to say it was delicious!  I had a roast beef sandwich and even took the other half to work the next day and it was just as tasty!  My husband insists it was the best burger he ever had. Will definitely be back!,"They have great breakfast here. Lunch is pretty good too but not as good as the breakfast. Didn't expect much while deciding to enter on a whim, but pleasantly surprised one we were inside and seated. You have to try the pancakes, they are also a winner, and the hash as well. There's a lot to offer here so we'll be back for sure.",Good coffee and great service. The best meal in the city. The food was great. Nice place to get the beer.

106,4POPYEONJpkfhWOMx_PyGg,"My dad took me to this steakhouse for my birthday. It was one of the best meals I have ever eaten, thought it was pretty expensive. I am a big fan of seafood, seafood tower and lobster chowder was a hit. For the main course, I got the porterhouse steak and a side of lobster mashed potatoes. And my dad ordered filet mignon. It was all very delicious, but 250$ later. I wish it a bit cheaper, so I could come here more often.

Thank for great meal! "," Phenomenal. This is NOT like other steak houses. The decor and ambiance is very comfortable and beautiful. Bidet toilets in the women's room. The service is excellent, crumber for the table, fresh cracked pepper, wine poured once your glass gets low, complete attention to detail. The ""bread"" that's brought is a full olive and cheese spread. The caesar salad is delicious. The scallops are cooked to perfection and the pairings on the plate were unbelievable. The Chilean sea bass was crisped and tasty, with a seamless and unbreakable sauce. The truffle mac and cheese was delightful and light. I did not think H60 was more expensive than any other great steak house. Amazing meal and date night out. ", One of the best places in town for a steak. Always an amazing meal and excellent service. , My favourite steak in Toronto . I find the service and food always to be perfect ...more on the classic side .. But never a bad experience ,"  I love harour sixty. it's such an old world charming place. I also love that for a steak house, it offers a wide array of selection in other dishes (I hate going to steak houses when I'm not in the mood at the insistence of my company and not having any options). 
And of course, everything is super delicious and the service is always impeccable.  ","  It's pretty much as you expect for the money.

Nothing to complain in terms of food but in comparison to barbarians it is more expensive...

And no pickled vegetables for appetizers :(  ", Excellent steaks! Rented the private dining room for a group reservation. Food was excellent but room was noisy and at the end the orders all got mixed up and wait staff was bringing either wrong items or serving them to the wrong guests. I believe the food is great but the service could be better. ,"  Amazing experience here.  Top notch service, everything came through as expected for Harbour Sixty.  You get what you pay for.  We saw some Leafs hanging out at the bar and a couple who sat in front of each other for an hour and a half and did not say more than two words to each other. I guess money doesn't buy you happiness, but it can get you a solid meal.","This place has some amazing, tasty steaks!  They are breathtaking!  The menu also has seafood options that are just as delicious!  The only downside is that its pretty expensive, however you get top quality meat for what you pay for.  You won't even notice the price when your stomach is filled with the best seasoned meat you've ever had.","The food was great. My friend and I have been here a few times and it's a pretty pricey. I think the lobster is the best. It's very small, but I have been to to the sunset on the menu. I'm a fan of this place.

45,0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,The food is fresh and amazing. We ordered the grilled chicken platter and tea and everything was extremely good. You can tell the food is authentic and the owner is very friendly. This is our third visit in two weeks and we will definitely be back. ,"  Exceptional. Well priced, phenomenal service, fresh and high quality ingredients, and delicious food. I had beef kabob, rice, and vegetables, accompanied with the fresh, made daily in house bread. The meal was served with a great salad, which may be the nicest house salad I've ever seen. I found myself returning the next day and tried the chicken kabob, which was again perfectly cooked and seasoned. For the price you get a very good amount of food. They don't over do it at all, you will feel satisfied after your mean but not overly stuffed. I have no hesitation returning to this restaurant and recommending it to others.  "," MoMo's is an absolute gem of a restaurant!  The food is incredibly tasty--perfectly spiced and cooked.  All ingredients are fresh and high-quality.  If you are looking for truly outstanding, authentic, healthy food--this is your place.  Our server was incredibly attentive and welcoming.  Price cannot be beat--we fed our family of 4 here including fresh salads, delicious moroccan tea for all, generous meals, fresh-baked bread, and the amazing French cookie sampler, all for under $45.  We truly enjoyed this place and recommend highly to others! ","  The food was fantastic (lamb medallions) and the service was excellent. The food was cooked to perfection and tasted very fresh. The owner is very personable, friendly, and attentive. Make sure you tell them if you want the tea or not because it will be added to your bill. We never asked for it but it was presented so we thought it was included. Enjoy!  "," We haven't had good moroccan food in cleveland in quite some time. Place is a small sit down spot right down the block from cedar lee cinema. My wife and sis each had a kabob, one chicken and one beef they were both season well and pretty good, but not the best I ever had. But what I really enjoyed was the couscous which is a north african staple. The restaurant has couscous on fridays and tajines on saturday as specials. I got the lamb couscous (pictured) but beef and vegan couscous were also offered as options. Plus a pot of moroccan mint tea for $5, I will def be coming back to explore more menu options ","  Absolutely recommend this one and only Moroccan restaurant in Cleveland! Three of us shared tabouli, beef kabob, chicken kabob, Harira soup, French cookies and hot sweet mint tea. They cook with a wood fired oven that brings a delicious smokey flavor to the food. Even the veggies were cooked in the oven. The bread was divine! The decor was of course very Moroccan with fluffy sofas and several colorful poufs to sit on. Muhammed is a very friendly host. Definitely check this place out!  ","  An authentic Moroccan experience! Start with the mint tea and order the special of the day. If it is beef tajine (like today's lunch), then you're in for a real treat! The owner, Mo will start you off with a crisp salad and warm bread. A few minutes after you're done, he will bring out a traditional tajine earthen pot. Lift the lift and enjoy!  "," (4.5) Dope place with awesome tea and delicious cookies. The menu may be simple but the food is all great. Even the bread is delicious! Everything tastes extremely fresh. It's like the chef just bought everything the same day. 

The service is great and courteous. If you get the mint tea the server will give it to you the Moroccan way!","If you are in the market for some great fresh food this is a wonderful restaurant to check out. The food is authentically Moroccan and they always have great specials that change every day. All of their kabobs feature excellent cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, and are cooked and seasoned to perfection. I also recommend trying their mint tea, it is amazing.","I was hoping to try the medium rare chicken and fries. The food is good, and the food is pretty good. You will go to be a restaurant. The servers are very friendly and friendly. A small place is a good choice for lunch. It's a lot of chinese restaurants in the area.",0.3620689655172414,0.07017543859649124,0.15517241379310345

Typical business district downtown type eatery.  This is nothing fancy but it does hit the spot and is very well maintained.  If I were in the area, I would eat here again for a quick bite to eat for decent food and excellent service.   Food=3, Place=3, and Service=5. "," This review is for the salad bar, I feel like I need to warn you.  It's a total rip-off because they weigh your food.  $13 and some change for a salad!  Need I say more.  I definitely would've left out the rubber tasting chicken and nasty croutons.  I will stick with Jason's Deli, better selection and you can have all the salad you want for one price. ","  I was looking for just a place to get breakfast and coffee that didn't involve flashing lights or clouds of smoke.  I was relived to find this cafe within walking distance of my downtown hotel!  I had a toasted marshmallow iced latte and a breakfast burrito.  I don't remember which one I ordered but it was a vegetarian burrito with avocado and egg as two main ingredients.  And isn't that what is really most important?  it was also fun to people watch all the law enforcement officers and legal professionals as they came in.  Plus, free wi-fi!  Will definitely come again.  ", We found this place walking toward another breakfast cafe and decided to try their food instead. It was a great choice! Their food is really great and at a fair price too... We've since been back a couple times and have continued to enjoy this great spot! Antrese has been our server every time so far and we've been impressed by how nice and helpful she has been! Definitely recommend. ,"  This place is my new favorite!  Their coffee is soo good, you can make a ton of different combinations or just stick to the basics.  Their selection of teas are great too and they are amazing quality!  Super yummy. I had a pesto chicken pannini that was effing delicious.  The staff is super nice, the girls are really sweet.  Everything about this place it's awesome.   Totally go there!  ","  Let`s start with the good stuff first. Clean place and friendly workers. The paninis are great (a bit overpriced) but you definitely get what you pay for as it is a big portion. The buffet is great especially if you`re down on cash and want a variety of food on your plate. 

Cons: Breakfast is not great at all! I would definitely not recommend it at all. I`d rather go to Mcdonald`s for the same quality of food at a much, much lesser price.  ","  Awesome place for nice coffee and great delicious food!!! 
I would definitely recommend it ! 
Our new favorite restaurant for lunch in Downtown Las Vegas  
Thanks to the beautiful owner, Silvia!  ","  Great lunch spot downtown. Food tastes good. They also have one of the best-tasting coffees around - they use Illy, of course. Prices reasonable.","This place has a nice buffet, which in itself is a compliment and a negative. Their actual food they bring you isn't as good as the buffet in general, and they charge you by weight at the salad bar which is something you wouldn't really expect. It can come out expensive. Their coffee is decent though and the workers are friendly, and it's also pretty clean.",I'm so glad I'm looking for the food here.

On this trip we spent most of our time in the women's shoe section. I loved that if you wanted to try on a shoe, they just scanned the code & then someone came out with your size. However, it didn't seem to take any less time than if the floor associate had just gone and gotten them themselves. 

I've been to plenty of Macy's that have looked run down and in need of a facelift but this location looked great. There was 1 section that they were redoing, but other than that everything looked as if the store had just opened. A great experience all around. ","  Early this morning, Macy's Shiseido offered many gift cards and free donuts from the world famous Donut Bar hosted on TV's Food Network and Travel Channel. The store was full. Great security in the parking garage. There were so many people, they needed extra staff to help people park their vehicles. Donuts and coffee, great for starting a last minute shopping rush for the holidays, especially for those families leaving town for the weekend.  ", im not the biggest macys fan but this one is my favorite!,"This place is extremely busy and it leads to some somewhat poor customer service. The staff does wind up working very hard, but ultimately they are just short staffed and need more people to keep up with the volume of customers.

They suggested mixing it with lemonade and again, I told them the fresh lime was how I wanted my drink made.   After ten minutes of waiting the drink was finally made and I watched a fellow bartender drink from my drink.  He also allowed a customer sitting at the bar to try the drink.

So we arrived at 6:44 (1 min to spare) and they said we lost our reservation and the hostess table was extremely unprofessional and laughing and blaming it on us and was just being straight up rude.

Never heard a single complaint about them. I love it so much, I go weekly. That much.  ", 10/10 one of the best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh. Drinks are made fresh and delicious.

Recommend this drink with grass jelly ^_^ also the regular Thai tea is my fav at Fuku tea and a must have for people who love sweet drinks! ,"  Fuku is on my top two best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh! I would say Fuku is great for fruity/tea drinks, whereas at Everyday Noodles I'd prefer to get milk teas there. My go-to is usually the traditional green tea, no sweetness, tapioca topping with honey and peach/mango flavors. Or I would get the golden lemonade. 

Fuku is a really popular place to hang out with friends, do casual meet-ups, or even study. I think I usually run into someone I know every time I go there haha. Best bubble tea fix when coming back to school :)  ","  This little shop just had their soft opening, and so far, I'm really liking what Fuku Tea has to offer to Oakland. The bubble tea here is delicious and more customizable than the other bubble tea stores on campus (and cheaper than Chick 'N Bubbly), and the store sells cute pastries, including macaroons. Fuku Tea also sells loose, hot teas, which I will definitely be trying in the winter. I'm considering coming here from now on for at least their bubble tea.  ","  It was cool that you could choose ingredients and toppings. The people there also so nice and happy to start their first days

I went back there today and they still seems very excited about their business. They are happy to interact and provide good service. 

The tea there is also nice. I like both their green tea and black tea though so far I prefered green tea as it has a lighter taste in my opinion. I'm never tried the bubbled teas with milk but I recommened both the mango and the Almond flavor. Don't forget the tropica as they are what makes bubble tea fun right?  "," Nice little shop in the heart of Oakland; the boba was actually a little disappointing because it didn't mix as well as it should have, but the little dessert I bought (a chocolate mousse) made up for it enough for me to swing them up to a 4 star rating. Seems like a nice place to study. ","  I love how clean and straight forward this place is! They have a lot of the authentic loose tea options along with their signature milk teas and smoothies.

The service was friendly and fast. I also LOVE that they have a soy milk option. It changes EVERYTHING for me since I'm lactose-intolerant. I ordered the small Thai iced tea with soy milk and it tasted DELICIOUS. The tapioca pearls were soft and chewy. Prices were fair. 

I will come back here for future boba tea purchases!  ","  Great bubble tea. I got a coconut black tea with bubbles and was very happy with it. Glad to see they rinse their tapioca until they are fully hydrated and then hold them in a warm crock prior to serving, so they are not under-cooked at all upon serving.

Also, they don't skimp out on bubbles, I got about half a cup in a small tea. I'll be back again.","Great place for bubble tea , lots of options to customize your drinks and toppings!

Several of us went and had a great meal!  We shared appetizers: crab cakes, calamari, salmon sushi (special that day), and sweet potato fries.  They all were great (although the fries could have been crispier for me).  We all enjoyed our entrees.  I had the risotto with shrimp and asparagus and found it delicious.  We shared a couple of decadent desserts (made fresh and change daily).  We enjoyed the brownie with apricot pieces and a gelato with chocolate crunchies.  ","  Great ambiance.

It's not France--you need to have good customer service!!!  ONLY because my husband is Belgian, we stayed, he's used to bad service.  It's NOT clear when you walk in what to do--sit?  Menus?  Ordering at front and having 3-4 empty/half assed stares by too many people is a Mc Donald's concept,  and uncomfortable.  Especially the blond running the register.  Put her somewhere else, NOT front!  Drip coffee overpriced then $.75 refill?  Mon Dieu!  Again, very good, get your customer service/set up straightened out.  Bonne Chance!!! ","  Hidden lunch spot.

My fiancÃ© ordered the curry and rice and one chicken was pink, which he didn't enjoy. I ordered the satay beef soup. Which wasn't too spicy in my opinion. I thought it was good but it wasn't life changing or anything. The only reason we decided to check it out was because they're open late.  ","  After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this place a shot, especially cause I was craving soup. The seafood soup is very spicy and delicious. If you order take out/delivery the seafood broth comes in a separate bowl and you can add as much of it to the noodle as you like.  The sweet and sour chicken was just alright, nothing special to note. The pad thai has a generous amount of chicken and shrimp and tastes great. I got free coupons for Spring Rolls, and Roti with curry sauce for my next visit.  ","  Today was a lazy Sunday for me.. so I decided to order delivery. I've ordered the Thai fried fish cake, I find it lacking in flavour. 

I was craving for curry fish balls, the curry was not bad but the curry was a bit thick. 

The fried tofu was very tasty. Just enough flavour and it was crunchy. I really enjoyed this.

I've also ordered the Tom yum noodles, it was okay as the soup lacked the spice. 

I will definitely come back for the tofu and the iced tea!  "," Since the only other pho restaurant is pho 88 by empress, the food here is decent. However, service is lacking. I suppose you don't go to these places for service, but because of the other options around, I will not go back just for the average food. ","  OK place for a bowl of pho in the Finch area. The lime wedge was fresh and sprouts were crunchy. There is nothing really special or noteworthy about this place. 

I might try their tom yum or rice dishes next time I'm in the neighbourhood.  ","  Yummy pho within the North York area! Woohoo. 

I would say that I enjoy Angus Pho House's broth a lot as it contains lots of onions and scallions. I want to say that this place is quite consistent but unfortunately the last time I went, my friend got a very small portion in terms of meat and noodles, even though we both ordered the same size. Overall, I am quite satisfied with this place.

The interior is pretty standard, but you have to go downstairs to get to the washroom. This wouldn't stop me from going here whenever I feel like having pho!

Their vermicelli noodles are thicker here than anywhere else I've gone, but was delicious nonetheless. Great service and cheap prices made for a 4 star experience. ", Good decent pho in this area.  It's about the broth and it's delicious - you can taste the flavours had been boiling for hours.  Good sized servings and a nice menu with not much of everything else.  Keeping it simple with a classic Hunan chicken to classic house pho.  I would say the best in the area.,"Good pho here. Tastes authentic and pretty close to other places. Service is kind of lackluster though, but the food is good. The problem though is that this place can be a bit up and down on consistency and you're never going to get anything exactly the same.

I'll definitely go back. ," The food was a hit this time unlike last time I was here. Although the salad could improve a bit. The croutons in the Caesar salad were huge and since you can't really cut croutons I didn't eat them. The Pad Thai with shrimps was excellent. The calamari, although greesy, was very tasty. If you become a vVVIP member you get a $10 discount. The service was much better this time, maybe because we were seated inside and not in the patio. "," Ok - for the food at Jack Astors is good but it is not 4 stars by my rating scale!  What gets this location to 4 stars overall is the roof top patio!

Today I took two of my men tees for lunch and we grabbed a beer under the sun! Being 4 or 5 stories above Yonge street was great and this patio is huge! I have been here a few times in the past year and on a Thursday or Friday late afternoon or evening, this patio is a great stop if you are in the north end of the city before you head back downtown for the evening!

I like their new drink menu but since they changed their food menu, I haven't been a fan. So it's usual if opt out of food and just settle for drinks. "," Overpriced everything, low quality food. Save your money and go down the road to Nome, It's more luxurious and cost less. You would have to be foolish to pay $20+ for a burger, when Hero burgers is a quarter the price and down the road. Really not worth it, No offence. ","  Jack Astor's (this location) is hands down my favourite rooftop patio in North York. Food is alright, service is alright, price range is similar to restaurants like milestones and sharks. If quality dining experience (food wise) is what you're looking for I wouldn't recommend but definitely for drinks and hanging out with a decent view. 
Location is pretty convenient - near the TTC station and they have street parking available.
P.s. Recommend their Chicken quesadillas, Veggie pizza, the fishbowl cocktails. (Avoid their shrimp pasta - watery, Calamari - a bit greasy)  
Overall, good experience!  ", Really liked coming here! It was my first time and the food was amazing! The service was good and the atmosphere was great. It's definitely on the loud side and very casual. I had the chicken poutine and it was to die for. My boyfriend has the sirloin burger with pulled pork on it (big Texas burger I think?) and it was amazing. I had to have a second giant bite of it. Come here with friends for drinks for sure.,"The atmosphere inside is a bit loud, but the  large rooftop patio is a nice option. The service is decent, but you'll probably get quicker service if you're seated inside. Things are a bit pricey here but they do offer a VIP membership that can save you some money. The calamari is a bit greasy but there are other good options.","You will definitely be disappointed. I have been to the local times and the food is great.

Hamachi jalapeÃ±o had no zip or spice, and worst of all, calamari tempura was barely warm and tough. Sent it back, came back quickly and it was hot and tough. The batter was not delicate, lacked taste, and was clearly cooked previously and heated up. Mikuni's in Sacramento   area (several) is the best, and I had hoped this would be a similar experience.

All of the cakes looked good, but I decided to try the chocolate peanut butter cupcake.  The crunchy peanut butter frosting tasted delicious and the cake was good, but was not the best I have ever eaten.  And $3.75 was really expensive for one cupcake.  Oh well, it was my one cupcake in Vegas. "," More like the Cupcrapery.....

1. Pretty and sparkly on the outside, nasty in the inside.  

2.  I didn't read YELP first.  Fail.

3.  Basically the same as what everyone else said.  Dry cupcakes.  Frosting is gritty sugar.  Not even the fluffy or creamy kind.  Just gritty.

4.  I had the oh my gosh ganache, kir royale, coco frauline, and strawberry shortcake.   Out of the four the ganache was the most tolerable.  So I gave it four chances at least.  4 bucks on each cupcake.  Fail again.

Sure it's pricey but it's vegas. Anyways, would come back for a sweet treat.  ","  For the price, you would expect more.  

The deserts at the buffets were better!  ","  I don't know what everyone else is talking about. This place had a pretty good cupcake. I had a Kir Royale, raspberry cupcake, champagne infused, and with silver glitter to top. Maybe if I were super picky, I would say it was a tiny bit dry, but I'm not going to be so critical. The raspberry taste and the frosting made the cupcake fantastic. Yum. 

I'm hopefully going to try the cinnamon roll one and the orange-pineapple one.  ","  I'd give it a four if the goal was to have a Little Debbie, but even then this place falls short. Not a good choice. If you're looking for a sweet treat, there is a Pink Berry in front of The Cosmopolitan.","The cupcakes are pretty good. Not amazing, but good. Some people don't seem to like it but I feel that it just really depends on the person and what they are in the mood for. They have some unique flavors of cupcakes and quite a variety.

Even when vehicles were not available they always offered options for different vehicles. ," I rent cars for business purposes across many cities and for Vegas, choose Sixt only when I cannot find a luxury vehicle for a reasonable price from hertz, avis or national.  The checkin process never takes less than 30 to 40 min.  The staff are fine, but the process sucks, if you need to rent and pickup with speed, only go with Sixt if you are not in a rush.

Make sure you read what you sign! The contract I was presented when picking up the car had a .50 charge per mile over 100 a day, while the terms I agreed to online said unlimited.  I had them cross that off and initial it before I agreed to sign.

The lounge is also nice, and I love free soda. "," I reserved my rental car through Travelocity and I was thoroughly pleased.

I found them through Kayak and then booked a prepaid reservation directly on the Sixt site. The price was right - $49/day for three days' rental of a BMW 328i.

The return was also similarly fast and there were no fees or foolishness there either. ," We had never heard of this company. There price for rentals is what brought us to them.

Service: very friendly and you can see they are passionate in customer and in their work. 

Food: we only sample the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. It is on point. 

Drinks: they use Pilot Coffee Roasters Blend. I quite enjoy the Cortado. Since they are still soft opening, they are adjusting the taste. Hope they can work on the crema. It is still a better espresso drink in Markham.

The menu however didn't quite cut it for me. I'm vegetarian and there wasn't a whole lot on there that peaked my little taste buds. There's the usual spring rolls, fried rice, and soup you can go with but for such a high end restaurant I was expecting a little more. 

The one thing you absolutely HAVE to try though is their Jasmine tea. It's the most delicious tea i've ever tasted and honestly that almost made up for the menu being not so awesome. ", auto loses a star because asian food should not be this expensive... food was great and the service was good but i just feel like i can get better asian food for a better price elsewhere... next ," We ordered Peking duck, spicy lobster fried rice and Chinese broccoli.

my reservation.. ","  We go every year for our anniversary!  Always a special romantic meal to be remembered.

The seasoning blend they have to sprinkle on the salad is great, I have bought bottles of this as stocking stuffers before.  We had herb encrusted chicken, pacific shrimp, sirloin and filet.  For dessert we had the chocolate and dulce de leche fondue.","The restaurant has good food and the staff is really helpful and friendly.

113,4kDLEb1OgE7IrO54lCkn3A,"This was the best Mexican food I have eaten. 
I honestly wasn't expecting much. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere in a sense. We were looking for it, not realizing it was a restaurant converted from a house. And when you get inside it's super cramped. But once you taste the food you will fall in love.
I had the carnitas. Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun.
Was good food and fun. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area.  "," There are limited # of restaurants in the area , this place was decent. The restaurant ambiance is small and cozy. Seats about maybe ~20 people, our group took up 1/3 of the seating area. 

Recommend ordering the guacamole, the chips are very delicious.

I came here with a group of 8, we ordered a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed it. I got the lamb, the meat was tender and well seasoned. 

Ordered the hibiscus juice made in house, it was too sour. 

Food quality: 3.5/5
Service : 4/5
Price : 3.5/5 ","  Very nice staff, really cute place. Food looks nice and is not bad. It just doesn't taste like Mexican food. The ingredients are there, but the nuance of cooking, maybe how they roast their chilis and the combination of spices, doesn't taste authentic. The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense. I want my chip to be light, crisp and thin. Crunch, gone.  ","  One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! Family style servings and food tastes legit.
The deconstructed tacos are a great way to share with the family. We've been here a few times and it never disappoints. It gets quite busy for dinner, make sure to make early reservations. 

One tip, try the ceviche campechano.  ", We had pork carnitas (excellent) and lamb tacos (good). Solid service but felt overpriced and probably wont go back. ," Yum yum yum!!! Popped in here today for lunch. We had the whole place to ourselves because it was a Sunday and early. To begin with, the place is super cute! Absolutely love the decor. We started with the guacamole which was good. For my main, I had the beef brisket in salsa verde. It was flavourful and plentiful. I tried a bite of the carnitas too and it was so tasty. Will have that and the ceviche next time. Our server was so cute and very personable. I wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out because he was lovely. My lunch with one beer came to $35. I feel it was worth every penny. Highly recommend! ","  Good Mexican food in Toronto?  At Cocina Economica, the answer is an enthusiastic YES.  I pretty much had their entire menu, and all the dishes were quite good.  All the meats are served with rice, beans, corn tortillas and homemade (spicy) salsas.  The stand out dish for me was the Carnitas - falling off the bone.  I really enjoyed the vibe of this place.  ","  Top notch stuff.

Succulent meats (we had the braised beef shoulder and the pork belly) with all the fixings for more-than-you-can-reasonably-eat tacos (the dishes come with tortillas, beans, rice, and salsas for flavor). The flavor and cooking was on point; guac was also noms.

The decor was sweet and they had a nice (slightly hipster) vibe going on. Service was friendly. Unfortunately didn't try the drinks this time but they seemed promising.

Overall, a great food-preggers-inducing experience. Looking forward to returning to my new favorite Mexican place ;)","As far as Mexican places go, this one is a really good one. Been here a few times and not disappointed with the food or service. It's quite a fun restaurant too and good vibe all over.

We felt like that was the most unsanitary thing anyone could do - he could have just come from the restroom for all we knew.  Needless to say, lackluster service, mediocre food and lack of concern for the cleanliness of the food prep area will guarantee we will NEVER return. ","  We like the food and prices are reasonable. Our biggest complaint is the service. It took a bit long to get a server to come over and then it took our server a while to get our bread and drinks. They really need to develop a better sense of teamwork.  While waiting for things there were numerous servers standing around gabbing. It really gave us the impression of ""Not my table."" ""Not my problem."" Only other complaint is they need to get some rinse aid for the dishwasher. I had to dry our bread plates when the hostess gave them to us.  ","  Not enough staff is on hand the two times I have been in to properly pay attention to paying customers. I agree that the portions have shrunk over the years, and the effort is no longer there. It is convenient to have nearby but not worth my time when other great restaurants are around. Wish I could rate it better but it's just not that good at all.  "," Went to dinner with 4 others and had another bad experience at the Macaroni Grill.  When will we ever learn?  The server was not only inattentive, but p o'd when we asked to be moved to another table.  When the food came it was at best, luke warm.  They had run out of one of our ordered dishes, but didn't inform us until 20 minutes after we had ordered.  Running out at 6:00 p.m.: Really? More delay and no apologies. There is no excuse for a cold meal and poor service.  We will not go back since the Grill seems not to care and there are plenty of other restaurants which do. ","  The service is kind and friendly. 

However there was complementary bread served.

The Pizza I ordered was undercooked and had very little sauce.

Macaroni Grill has unfortunately taken a dive.  Best to avoid the place or at the very least this location.  "," I know this is a chain, but Between this and Olive Garden, I would def pick this place. Service was great at this location and food not bad at all, although not excellent, I think it still deserves a good 4 stars "," I had a  2 for 1 $9.00 express dinner coupon so we order up 2 dinners to go. The deal was 9 min or its free, it took 20, but since I was getting 2 meals for $9.00 I did not make a fuss. 

 The actual pasta was fine and amount was fair but it  had maybe a 1/4 of a chicken breast. The chicken tasted like it came from Taco Bell, VERY processed. The sauce straight from a can.

 I have had much better frozen dinners. My husband and I used to like Macaroni Grill it sad too see its food go so down hill. "," The atmosphere was great, friendly server. Although the food I think is served from frozen. I ordered mama trio. The two of three items were great. Plate came out hot, couldn't touch it. Went to eat lasagna and was ice cold in the center, nit even warm. 
The server apologized about it offered new one or reheat this one. I chose a new one to go. I saw her go tell manager. The manager didn't even come over and say anything. I was not even acknowledged on my way out and walked past 3 people. I will not be going back. Over priced for frozen food.","I'm really not a fan of Macaroni Grill, well, at least THIS Macaroni Grill.  The staff is slow and really doesn't seem to car about providing quality service.  It took well over 30 minutes to get my food and the place wasn't even packed with people.  I ordered pizza and it didn't taste right.  I think it wasn't fully cooked.  I won't be coming back.","The waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable. It's a bit loud but I have never had the food and it's just a little pricey. It's a great place to eat for dinner.

It's only about a half mile away so a perfect stop after the beach. We had our dog with us so sat on the patio, which was perfect. We enjoyed a mix of sandwiches and burgers and we're pleased with the vegetarian and vegan options offered. Everything was huge, especially the burgers which were really thick. For sides, the sweet potato fries and 3 bean salad were clear winners. They also looked to have a large beer selection but we didn't try any.

They did a great job cleaning up and decorating the patio - which is now a great place to watch all kinds of neighborhood happenings. 

I've heard from people who know that they have a great burger - so that's next on my list.  "," Absolutely amazing! The menu offers a wide variety of great tasting food. In our party of 5 we all ordered something different and each and everyone of us was blown away by the taste, freshness and size of it all! This is a place that you need to come back time and time again to get the full experience. Not to mention the friendliness of the staff and the quickness in which the food was prepared. Along with the food they also have a wide variety of beer to perfectly pair with your meal (and they don't silently judge you for getting a beer with your early lunch!).

However, when I do get in there, it is always right on the mark for what I craved. The folks who work there are always nice, and when the weather permits, their patio is a great spot to eat and hang out.","The best thing about this place is the fact that there's something for everyone.  If you have a group of friends that are vegetarian, they have stuff on the menu.  If you have heavy meat eater friends, there are lots of amazing burger options.  They also have a great alcohol menu with wine and beer to try out.  I feel like I can come here when I'm in the mood for anything!",Food is always fresh and the atmosphere is great.

It was so yummy we even forgot to take a picture of it. Recommend getting this for sure. We also got the house made cheesecake- really yummy and different.

Beautiful salads with perfect avocados and fresh ingrediants. 

I recommend the chicken torta: black beans, chicken, avocado, cheese, tomato, on a bolillo roll. Yum, yum, yum!  "," I don't know of a better place in Charlotte to get a sandwich or a wrap.

Would return again! ,"  Find yourself a better spot. No receptacle next to the bed for medical equipment.  Toilet must be really old, they're low, like for kids.

You get the idea. The room seemed reasonably clean.  ","  Best value for the money in Scottsdale. Recently renovated rooms look more like something out of Vegas for two-thirds the price of nearby competitors.
Staff is incredibly accommodating. Stephanie is a closet Victoria's Secret model and a sweetheart. She helped me look through the maid's trash to find a discarded piece of paper (my buddy's fault, not the hotel's). 
Also, someone may have gotten sick on the sheets and they didn't charge us extra. I'm stopping now.  ", Staff was friendly and my 1 night stay was without a hitch. The room was clean and the pool was relaxing. ," I heard Amanda the manager sells crack out of the back office.

But seriously. Amanda was the most unpleasant, rude hotel staff person I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Charged $25 for an early check-in then failed to notify us that our room was ready. Woke up our driver to inform him there's an 8 person limit per hotel room. We have 8 people and 2 hotel rooms. When we informed them of their mistake they kicked us all out and called the police.

The girl at the front, I believe her name is Jessica, went above and beyond to get me in and then rescheduled my appointment to a sooner date so that I could have my hair done before my daughter is born. Simone's book was completely full but they worked their magic and got me in. I am a very picky blonde, and Simone nailed it. She is a super talented hair stylist as well very sweet.

When she first saw it she started to get a new one but couldn't pull it out right away so she gave up and used the ripped one. Slightly disappointed. I'm not expecting fine dining, but would at least like it to be comparable to other visits.  ","  I love Chipotle, but this one gave me FOOD POISONING. Whoever it was I talked to at their corporate wasn't quite helpful, although the manager at this Chipotle was very accommodating when I reported the food poising. They're  nice, but the quality they make when it comes to burrito is not great. It would spill or the burrito wouldn't be wrapped properly. I prefer going to other Chipotles than this one.  "," Possibly the worst Chipotle I've been to in town. Most of the employees that have served me barely put anything in my bowls. I asked for a little bit more steak, and the lady literally scoops out 1 piece of steak. Cheese? They sprinkle that on there like it's the last bucket of cheese they have for the next month. And the guacamole? Guac is extra, so I expect at least a proper scoop. She gives me half a scoop. Seriously? In the end I feel like I'm not eating a steak bowl, but rather a vegetable one. "," Well I love Chipotle and since I was with my sister after shopping it was the closest location, it was her first time eating here. The food was great but the redhead that works their was rude and impatient to my sister, she's only 12 and it was her first time and she wasnt sure what to get so the red head was rolling her eyes and idk If she's gonna work for a fastfood place she needs to learn to be patient. Other than that 4 stars good food that's why! Burrito Bowl my favorite! ", I eat here almost everyday for lunch! The wait can be long at certain times but worth the wait- the regular staff is awesome and friendly and they remember my order - I only have issues when they have visitor or new employees but they still get 5 stars because they move the line and are friendly and the food is always fresh and amazing! ," As a UNLV student I always find myself at chipotle for lunch in between classes or picking up something to take home after a long day. This particular location is ALWAYS busy, therefore the foods always fresh ! Even though all of the employees are fairly young, the service is great. They'll let you sample things you haven't tried, and suggest a new spin to put on your burrito. Love love love. 

I only doc 1 star because the lines between 12 and 2 (lunchtime) are lonnnnnnnnng. And they will not make quesadilla style burritos during lunch rush (lame). ", i like getting the 3 taco combo here. the salsa is so flavorful! i like getting the bowls too. heck.. i like everything here! the only downside is you gotta eat really fast or get a separate basket for the tacos cuz they get really soggy at the bottom from the juice from the meat and salsa. they get so soggy the taco comes apart before you bite into it. but if you can get it into your mouth without the insides falling out from the split.. kudos! ,"  Below standard, even for Chipotle. Rice was not cooked all the way. Food was lukewarm. Salsas were flavorless(maybe not fresh?) Pretty disappointing.","Chipotle is normally a high quality fast food restaurant where you can get high quality burritos and chicken/rice bowls.  This particular Chipotle however, is anything but high quality.  They don't give you enough food to eat.  The food they do give you to eat is stale or old.  Even if its not old food, they way they give it to you is usually very sloppy.  I don't recommend this place at all.","Ordered a few tacos for a large tacos and it was amazing. I've been to several times and this is a great experience. The menu is the best mexican food I've ever had. They have a lot of tv, but it's not to get any of the <unk> food.

I order the lasagna and was very disappointed, it was COVERED in sauce with barely any cheese or meat. I most likely will not return here. the only thing that was good was dessert, which is wonderful. "," Got takeout for lunch. The new online ordering app worked seamlessly. I ordered Chicken Marsala with cavatappi ameritriciana, which was delicious. The lunch portion cost less than dinner, but doesn't include soup or salad. You can add those for $2.

Came with 2 baskets of whole  wheat pitas which were warm and soft :) We each had  different entrees ;  Grilled calamari salad ( calamari was grilled perfectly), small lamb souvlaki dinner, large pork  souvlaki dinner,  and a salmon dinner  -- all came with a starter greek salad and rice, potatoes, and mixed veg. 

Will definitely  come back! "," This is a huge restaurant; it has 2 separate patios and a ton of indoor seating. I've come here on many separate occasions in the past, and while it hasn't disappointed me, I can't say I've ever been wow-ed. I had the small pork souvlaki dinner with rice and roasted potatoes ($14.95). The portion sizes are good and the tzatziki is super garlicky (I do love garlic). The potatoes they gave me (3) were also huge!! So, I left very full (and feeling like I undid my workout just before). ","  Love the great comfort food this place offers, they also have a fab patio in the summer!  ","  This place definitely has problems with consistency, but it has remained one of my favourite places on the danforth. I usually only go there for take-out, electing to go to pantheon when I want to get a table. At one point the grill men were actually greeks (maybe a greek guy still pulls an occasional shift) but that seems like it was ages ago.

In any case, the lamb sandwich on a bun with extra tzatziki is my pick, although sometimes the chunks of lamb are just too fatty and make for a chewing struggle. Depends on the day. Oh yeah, and be prepared for onion breath. Those are raw onions :)  ", I was in here today November the 7th  we ordered few things I'm surprised how terrible it is the quality it's not there like they used to be the best on the Danforth when some Greek American had purchased the place since he sold it n the knew  guys picked it up its not the same terrible The management should wake up and smell the coffee and  not to get greedy  the most recent operator looks like a lost farmer ....!!!! ,"  This is the best Greek restaurant on the Danforth- Greek Town!

You can't really go wrong with any of the Greek restaurants in this area - we have tried just about all of them over the years, but if you want the best one, Astoria is it.
Patio if great. Service always fantastic.  One litre bottles of wine: great. It probably has the largest seating capacity in the area so getting is usually not a problem. Opa!  ","  This was my favourite restaurant on the Danforth but unfortunately, it no longer is. The prices have increased and the quality of food has decreased. 

Today I ordered their pork souvlaki dinner. The starter salad was too salty to eat and on top of that, the pork was burnt to a crisp. 

Other restaurants on the Danforth will charge the same (some even less) and give you far better quality food. I would only go to Astoria as a last resort from here on in.  ", Decent food at a decent price is my tag line for this place.  The portions are generous and the service was friendly.  It seems like this place has been around for a while and you know what you are getting in this family style-ish restaurant.  This won't be the best Greek meal you'll ever have though.  I think it hits the spot but this place seems to be more about the quantity and deriving flavor with lots of cheese & oil as opposed to using the best or fanciest ingredients on the market.  The wine and beer list is also quite limiting.  So just enjoy it for what it is.,"There's some issues here with being consistent all the time, but it's a big place and the service is generally good. The prices have gone up since it first opened and the food quality isn't consistent at all. It's either good, OK, or just bad. You'd expect to pay a lot lower in price for the quality of food they are serving. It's got a good comfort feeling and ambiance to it though.","If you are looking for a quick bite, go to the table, and the food is good. My boyfriend got the shrimp appetizer and it was delicious. So we went in the patio for lunch and got the same day. I am so glad I have ever been to this place. It's not much of the better places.

96,3l5TusofKjr8rk6-DDtuoQ,I had purchased a Yelp deal for here. My daughter and I went for lunch on a Sunday at around 11:30. Walked in and there were no customers - we were told they had changed there Sunday hours and did not open until 1 pm! The manager said to come in and they would still serve us anyway - I thought this was very accomidating! Both the food and service were very good - more than enough food for the 2 of us to share and still have leftovers. , I was very impressed. Service was good food was awesome atmosphere was very soothing.. very nice date place.. loved it. , We just discovered this place. The meals were great. I had chicken kabob wrap and my wife had beef shawarma. The live music complemented the food to create the perfect environment. Everything was authentically Middle Eastern. , Very good service and wonderful food! All around a great restaurant. The chicken kabob was amazing & very flavorful! ," Service was good
Shawarma was average. I'd've had much better. The kicker was $1.50 charge for water. Seems like the ultimate cheap move to me. "," Authentic sophisticated flavors in every bite!!!

GO NOW..Go tomorrow..Go this week...SO YUMMY! ","  The food was great, and worth the little extra most places charge, but it's a restaurant, not a gyro n burger place.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Pita bread, but that's my ONLY complaint  "," The place is clean and the servers are nice. 

The food was a little lacking in flavor. We had Chicken kaabob, kefta, fries and rice. The chicken was good, needed more marination. The kefta was boring and the rice was horrible, old and dry. The garlic spread they use with the chicken is awesome and very very strong garlic. 

I used the yelp deal but the meal only can to $22 so I have a yelp deal to go back. I just am not sure I will. Maybe for the live music???","If you are craving some Mediterranean food this is a great place to check out. They have some great kababs, greek salads, and even a fantastic shawarma. Everything always comes out fresh and is served by a very friendly and attentive staff. I highly recommend checking them out, they also have some great live music too!",My only complaint is about it's so good.

Strawberry chicken salad was tasty, but chicken was tough and over cooked and mixed greens had way too many browning pieces of lettuce. The candied pecans were delicious, though.

Very disappointed.... ," Customer service is always more important than the food quality, that's why I give it 1 star. I was in the drive thru, had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffee (there was more ice than coffee) and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice. I guess she thought I was stupid and that I wouldn't notice. So I sent her back to take out more. Do the job right the first time and you won't have to do it twice. I guess she didn't think I would notice that she didn't even take out any ice. ", My frozen hot chocolate was delicious but they only cream cheesed one half of my bagel.

Tried their vegetarian falafel and dipitizer (roasted red pepper and jalapeno hummus). Couldn't of had a better combo.  the GF always requests it when im in the area. nice and clean and the owner is really cool and down to earth.  ","  Stopped here yesterday and got take-out. I've eaten at their other location several times and it has seemed like the food has slightly changed over time. Not for the better. I was very disappointed to see a man throw a bag of gray gyro meat chunks on the grill as I walked in. So I guess they don't slice the meat fresh off a spit. My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared. Their hummus was still good but could use a little more garlic or something.  I'll be taking a lengthy break from Pita Cafe.  ", The jalapeno hummus was very good and a little spicy. The pita chips that came with it were nice and soft and warm. I had the chicken shawarma and the chicken was very delicious as was the sauce. I think this place will do well. ," Nice small family owned cafe close to  Nothing Bundt Cakes.

We ordered the Gyro and Chicken Pita which each were $5. Both were very good and tasty. Just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over.

This is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food.

I liked this place and for $5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza.

Will definitely be back again and try other items from the menu. ","  Just as awesome as the other location.  I love that this is a family run business.  This location is super clean, and I love that they have so many places to sit.  The food is always top notch, fresh and comes out fast.  ", Always loved this place... But had a Mediterranean gyro .. Was really bad. Soggy .. Lettuce bad and lots of oil ! The salad was not good either.. Was like it was sitting out for awhile. Not fresh. Bummer !,"Like most places, when this first opened it was excellent. Slowly though it has been going downhill and quality has been getting worse. The gyro meat doesn't seem fresh and kind of weird looking. I'd say avoid the gyros because they are pretty bad, but their other food is pretty good. Service is ok too. I was a little disappointed because I expected better from a family run business.","The delivery was very friendly and the staff was very friendly and attentive. There's plenty of other pizzas, but I've been to. It's a little pricey but worth it. And you can eat the meal with a chicken and wings. The food is delicious and the food is always fresh. I love this place.",0.35937500000000006,0.031746031746031744,0.171875
188,7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,Came on a Saturday night at 830.   All apps for a group of four were forgotten.  I expressed my love of spicy food to our server and I am an adventurous eater.  He recommended lamb masala.   It was Very bland even with eating all red peppers included.   Never offered a refill on our beers or cocktails. Lousy experience and will be looking elsewhere for Indian. ," This was my second time trying the buffet. They change the buffet menu daily! And it's only $9.99. Everything we tried was delicious. Buttered naan, lollipop chicken, paneer, spicy fried peppers. Service was great. So glad good Indian food has made it to Tremont. ", Amazing food. Being Indian I can say it's authentic.  The new dessert mango kulfi is out of this world.  The owners go out of there way to accommodate special food restrictions like food without onion and garlic.  Will come again. ," One of the first Indian restaurants I've been in with a full bar with 2 pages of wine, lots of craft beer (at reasonable prices) and specialty mixed drinks. It's a small, quaint comfortable place with benches and seat cushions (plus regular chairs).  We had 2 martinis- I thought the mango lassi martini was a great idea and tasty! The menu had a great array of vegetarian options as well. Items in blue are chef specials I had a mushroom chef special which was so good.  Would definitely come back. ","  We went fr the dinner ala carte, nd chose the vegetarian menu fr the nyt.. bad evening maybe, bt the soup nd starters were on a minus note, nd the gravy fr the maincourse wasn't tht great eithr.. hwevr, the naan nd othr bread varieties wer aromatic nd tasted amazing.. Overall, ths place s too pricy, scores fine for the ambience, bt the flavors r jst Ok..! Definitely nt worth the tym nd money spent here..  ", Probably one of the better Indian food in the greater Cleveland area. We were greeted right away and there was no wait. We ordered and appetizer & our entrees at the same time. The appetizer never came out but dinners did. We didn't feel like asking for the appetizer since our entrees came out. We ordered items off the tandoori menu and a curry dish. All delicious. Definitely be going back again! ,"  Poor customer service, overpriced mediocre food. Take your business somewhere to a more friendly restaurant. I wouldn't go other again  ", Very welcomed addition to Tremont and such friendly staff! Andrei is wonderful and takes the time to get to know his customers by name and remembers our likes and dislikes. The chef was able to beautifully accommodate my nut allergy so I could enjoy the wonderful food!  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!,"Their buffet is worth it. It changes daily and is the same price every day. Not the friendliest people here though and food, which authentic, might not be to suited to all tastes. There is a bar here which is nice, albeit small, but comfortable. Not too expensive considering what is offered.","And this place is very clean. A bit of the best indian food I've ever had. Definitely recommend the restaurant. It's a great place to eat lunch with friends. And I will definitely be back. We had the pleasure of the special sauce, and the panang curry.",0.19801980198019803,0.0,0.11881188118811882
36,0NgePUfXd2TG0kWgsQRq0A,Been coming here for years! I love that you can build your own bowl. They offer lunch and dinner prices. For dinner the yogurt is included. This location is always clean. The staff is nice and they always greet you at the door. The line where you build your bowl is always tidy and looks pretty. The staff is always monitoring it to make sure everything looks good. The grill is always hot and they clean it often. So no old caked on burnt food from 2 hours ago. They offer doggie bags for .50. Trust me it tastes even better the next day too. Definitely a place that will fill you up. ,"  My MIL's boyfriend took us here to meet up with some of his local family when they were in town. I didn't know what to expect walking in at all, and actually almost didn't come (we had some deliveries scheduled that day, but they finished early), and I'm so glad I made it! Others have described the process, and they're right. It is very tasty, but I did struggle with making my sauce, I didn't think the ingredients available were labeled very well. The employee helped me out and made the sauce I wanted though. I will say the beef was better than the chicken (in my opinion at least) so I'll be sticking with that next time.  ","  This isnt the worst food I have ever tried but I definitly will NOT be going back there anytime soon.

I dont know how fresh the vegetables are but it is a good alternative to fast food. 
The meat is frozen and kinda grossed me out so I recommend the tofu, although I cant speak for its quality.

The service was fast and you get to decide how much of each ingredient you want.  ","  Went into the resturant last night with my husband and daughter and baby. Didn't know how the whole system worked... The lady that checked us in explained everything and was super friendly.
The food tasted nice and fresh and the portion was huge. The kids were super excited to find out the meal came with ice cream at the end.
Right before we left the lady working at the front came and asked how everything was. The costumer service was on point and we will definitely be going back.  ", I emailed the company just to let them know about my experience and the employees that were acting so unprofessional.  I was contacted (hadn't expected that) and was very impressed at the customer service and concern over my experience.  It restores some of my faith in customer service in general and in the care this manager had for his company.  I will give them another chance. 5 stars for this managers response and handling of the situation. ,"  My boyfriend and I come here after we fight! It's actual therapy... we leave happy.  The food is incredible, the mood is nice and quiet, and you don't wait for ever...  ","  Every time I go to YC''s I always have a great experience. Service is great, food is good, place is always clean! The price is the best because it's not expensive but the food is awesome. Making your own sauces is a fun experience also.  ", If you know how to pack your bowl its ok. The card reader automatically adds 15% tip so you gotta either figure it out or tip 15%...haha. $30 seemed a bit much for 2 ppl. They charge .50 per take home container,"This is a good place to come if you are looking to build your own custom bowl of food and know exactly what you want. It can be a little bit daunting when you are looking at all the options, but the staff is attentive and available to help you pick out your entrees. I would say that the food always winds up coming out fresh and the prices are very reasonable. If you're in the mood for some good food  quick check out this spot!",My first time coming here. The food is delicious and the service is great. I have to say that they are very nice and always helpful. I will definitely be back. I had the # star at the end of the day. Great place to grab a bite and it's always good.,0.40287769784172667,0.072992700729927,0.17266187050359713
