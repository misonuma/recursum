If you ever are at Terminal 4, great spot for food and drinks. Plus there are many places to recharge your phones and computers. ","  Great food!! Everything tastes great and was truly fresh as advertised. I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). The eggs were fresh, the bacon looked and tasted like real bacon, the waffle was fluffy and delicious and the orange juice which came out of a gigantic plastic jar I'm sure was squeezed that morning. A+  ","  So I had the pleasure of eating at both locations while in PHX and this one out did the original!  I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :).  For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese.  They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick.  Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight.  Prices were good so I strongly recommend!  ","  Quick service all around. Amazing food... Sky Harbor has revamped their food choices and I can honestly say this place is up there with Arizona top breakfast places (heard good things about their other locations as well.)
Great ok every way. 
Oh, and the bacon. The bacon was unbelievable.  ", What a fantastic spot to grab a meal. I got the Bloody Mary and meatloaf. Every ingredient in the Bloody Mary was perfect. Extra crispy celery. Briny olives. Crispy thick bacon. YUM. Meatloaf was excellent. , Very good breakfast that was well prepared.  The Bloody Mary is an excellent choice. It comes with a salad bar in it! I highly recommend it. ,"  We were surprised to find Matt's Big Breakfast at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. We usually visit the downtown location when we travel to Phoenix, but ran out of time this trip.  
Low and Behold, we got our fix at the airport.
The menu is a little different than the restaurant. Caters to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
The food is still great!  ","  Dang this place was good! Before traveling, my SO and I stopped here to eat since we had time and I was not disappointed. The hostess was a bit dry, bored, and wrung out but the rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly so I won't let her influence my opinion. This place seems like the spot that would be packed all of the time, so expect to be rubbing elbows with a stranger while you eat. Aside from this, the food was great! I got their grilled cheese and french fries which were fantastic, they use a really thick bread which made the sandwich even better. I would definitely come here again...if I'm ever delayed and forced to fly Southwest again -_____-","This place is delicious.  Its a great place to go when you get off your flight, or if you are waiting for your plane to come.  It has delectable breakfast food.  It has everything you could want, such as eggs, bacon, waffles, and more!  I definitely recommend coming here for a big breakfast.",Great service and the food is good. I would definitely recommend this place. And the menu is a bit of the way. My friend and I went here for lunch and the breakfast. I'm so glad I was in the mood for a sandwich.

You will not find smile on the Owners Face.
No cooler hot like hell.
Not Clean to expected standards.
Inexpensive food.

I think businesses come and go in the shopping center these guys are in though so eat there! So I can continue to eat there. :) ,"  food here is average with poor quality
for example paneer butter masala was lime water with no paneer and few onions
and place is not very hygenic
the owner took order from folks and took payments written something on paper for phone order cleaned tables and he went to kitchen put masala stuff on the dosa with bare hands and rolled dosa with bare left and right hand. come on atleast use plastic gloves it so gross
not going again  "," should be rated as 0.  worst place to eat in phoenix. worst indian food. raw and uncooked. stinking meat. rotten meat served. will cause food poisoning.  never eat in this place. if you eat, eat at your own risk.

Not a place to dine in. Small stuffy and hot, with the hot oil & burners in close vicinity to the seats. The biryani & chicken curry are good. Paneer mattar (ie., cheese with peas) is a waste, you get 3 pieces of paneer floating in curry or 4 if you're lucky. Being in Scottsdale, decent Indian food is hard to come by. So this little hole in the wall stands out! It is on the spicy side, which is great if you like that. The big plus is... they recently opened an Indian grocery store next door. They have a good variety of spices, daals etc.","This place really isn't that great.  The atmosphere could be so much better.  The restaurant is pretty small and hot, so its really annoying when there are a lot of people.  It just makes me feel uncomfortable.  The food is average at its very best.  At its worst, you get chicken that is old, with sauce that is watered down and flavorless.  I'd definitely skip this place next time.","The place is nice and the food is always fresh.

8,-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ,Such delicious food and decently priced considering you are right on the strip. The Long Beach sushirrito was probably my favorite thing on the menu and it is definitely one of my favorite. Everything is so fresh and tasty and it feels great on your system. It's definitely a must if you are looking for something delicious and fresh. ,"  I liked this place. I thought the service was really good and the food tasted delicious. You can choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. I got the bowl and asked for half greens and half brown rice. I wasn't a fan of how they made you pick a pre-made poke bowl because it didn't allow you to create your own creation. Also, I felt like my bowl was drenched in too much sauce. Other than that, this place was conveniently located and was an overall great experience.  ","  I have to admit that I am a bit of a Sushi burrito snob. I am a Sushirrito (San Francisco chain) fan. Big fan actually. Though, Jaburrito takes it to ANOTHER LEVEL!  ","  This place was ok. Coming from LA where there are tons of ""sushi burrito"" spots, I thought I'd get something a little bigger and with more flavor. It's a small meal for what you pay for. Nothing special. Might as well be called a poke place. Not worth venturing out for.  ","  After watching the show ""O"" at the Bellagio we stopped in to have a late meal. I had the summer special Acapulco bowl. It had flavor and the jalapeÃ±o had a strong kick, washed it down with Asashi beer. It was extremely tasty and satisfying for the sushi crave.  ", I ordered the Redondo burrito like so many other Yelpers and it was fantastic.  I was watching them make the burritos and they put so much in them that even though it comes out small it is very hearty meal.  I also ordered a side of miso soup which had huge chunks of tofu in it.  The staff was extremely friendly and my food came out fast.  The price was very reasonable and there was a lot of seating both indoors and outdoors.  Can't wait to go back! ," Unfortunately a restaurant that says it's open until 12a on Fridays but tells people they are closed at 11:56p and turns you away will get a 1 star from me!  
Bad form JaBurritos...bad form indeed! ","  Sushi burritos are becoming quite the thing in Vegas; between them and poke places, there are an abundance of options around. I've had the item at a few places, and my point of reference is Yoshi Burrito, the first place at which I had the dish. That is, for me, a four out of five star place. This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi. It's not a bad place, and if you're in the area, you certainly can do much worse, but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to get there.","If you are hungry and in need of a sushi burrito spot, this is the place to go.  You can actually choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl.  They definitely make sure you are full when you leave because each option is loaded with tons of rice.  Every option is filled with many unique flavors that will have leave the place with a full stomach.",It's a great place to go for lunch. I will definitely be back.

Going to Yinzburgh is so much easier than driving down to Georgia when you're craving good bbq. Try the pulled pork, try the ribs, try the bbq burritos! I love gorging on this restaurant's food. 

Yinzburgh is truly an oddity in Oakland. Pierogies are fine, so is pizza, but where in this state can you find proper barbecue? Yinzburgh, that's where.

The woman behind the counter walked me through their process and got me to sample all the sauces.  The second time back she wanted me to try out a new dish they had just put on the menu.

The only downside... It's quite far :( Although I will definitely come back here! Since I LOVE pizza!","I've gotta say, their pizza is absolutely amazing.

Ordered orange beef, sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp vegetable,  all were really good surprisingly.  The orange beef is probably the best I've had from a delivery, could use a lil more spiciness.

The shopping experience I get here is never negative in the slightest way. Great products, great prices, great store. Highly recommended.

We had hot dogs, the cheeseburger, and chicken fingers (for the kids). I personally had El Mexicano and it was super tasty, but $7 for a single hot dog is a little bit ridiculous. The kids didn't like the chicken fingers and the burger was just bad. Customer service was not great either. The cashier had a little of an attitude problem taking our ""complex"" order.

Quail egg? Yum. Seaweed? How did I not think of that before?

We grabbed a beer as well and sat in the outdoor deck space. This whole container park is pretty adorable and wholesome... Especially when you stop to realize you're in Vegas.

Overall, this spot is approachable and also hip... Much like a hot dog with a quail egg on it.  ", I ordered the El Mexicano and the Cheffini's dogs and both were great. The Mexicano had a green cilantro sauce on top that was perfectly tangy with a lot of flavor. And the crunch of the bacon wrapped around the hot dog was a great texture change.

The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar.

Moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist. They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well. Makes me wish I learned more as a kid.

Our server was abrupt and unfriendly. I got a beef burrito but was surprised when it came out with no sauce on top (it was just a simple tortilla with beef and beans in it). It would have been very plain had I not poured some of the chip salsa on top. My friend got a shrimp dish which he thought was decent.  ", I gave it one star only because the service was excellent. The mild salsa is tomatoe sauce with chili powder. The hot salsa is mild enough for a Midwesterner. They put VegAll in EVERYTHING! Seriously? Potatoes and Lima Beans in Tamales? Carrots and Corn in taco meat? I'm frankly embarrassed they are even in business. It is a great dishonor to a fine cuisine that I love dearly. Great service but the food is horrendous. Do not waste your time and money. Honestly? Taco Bell is better!!!! , I love this place been going for YEARS and i go ESPECIALLY FOR THE SALSA!! i would drink it if i could..i sometimes order and entree but i usually get chips and some appetizers.  Best salsa in vegas dont care anybody says!!!,If you're in the mood for some authentic Mexican food this is one of the best places to go in Vegas. They have been around for over thirty years and continue to make fantastic fresh Mexican food. The service here is also very friendly and attentive. Their salsas are all made fresh in house and are some of the best in town as well. I highly recommend checking out this place!,"I'm not sure if I didn't have to say the food was good. It's a small place to go for lunch. We have been here for years and the food is great. The tacos are a bit expensive, but I will be back. The service is very friendly and attentive.

33,0GVu1xLqxbUQLfSCp25OGQ,"My favorite boba joint in Chandler. The tea is always made fresh and the boba is always perfectly made (awesome chewiness). My usual order is Honey Milk Tea Boba with 1/2 sweetness (full is too sweet for me).

If you're looking for great boba milk tea, Tea Street is the place to go. "," Went here 2 days ago and it was my first visit. I live around the corner and had been skeptic to try a new boba place since I already had my favorite on Dobson. I can say for a first visit this place is AMAZING. Great service, my cousin loved it, they had so many drinks. I had gotten the green tea milk tea and was worried about the dairy bc I'm lactose intolerant but the cashier/tea barista assured me that all of the milk teas are dairy free, FANTASTIC. It was really good, great drinks and not to mention the cashier lady was super cute plus plus. 

I will be coming back. ", Lots of different flavors of milk tea and every one I've tried has tasted amazing. Prices are reasonably fair compared to other tea and Boba places. Very friendly staff. I'd recommend trying the Brown Sugar Milk Tea if you like sweet drinks! ,"  Visited again today, ordered matcha milk tea and earl grey milk tea. The barista made sure the drink wasn't too sweet, but both milk teas did not have the flavor of tea I was looking for in the last three milk teas I've tried (TeaStreet, Strawberry, Osmanthus). I won't hold that against them and hope to try more milk teas and top ten drinks.  ","  I'm sitting here, as we speak, digesting my large peach milk tea that had the popping lychee boba in it. 

Typically I'm waiting for that ""ugh I ate too much"" feeling that I get after boba or real sweet teas... 

Doesn't seem to be coming. 

The milk tea was super light and the peach tasted really good. Lychee added a bit of tartness which is fantastic. 

Huge menu! Can't wait to come back and try more.  "," ""Like! Green"", that's the drink I got...

You know how scotch whiskey and sushi can be an acquired taste? This drink is like that. 

Initially, this drink gives a overwhelmingly almond fragrance. I hated it, it was gross. However I spent 5 bucks on this damn drink, so I continued and begrudgingly sucked it up. Weirdly, as I was halfway done, I  stopped noticing the weird almond flavor and started tasting the green tea matcha. I'm confused, and probably will have something traditional at this place next time, if I have to come back. "," The drinks here aren't so great, and that would normally make me give fewer stars, but their ""Grand Canyon"" on their Top 10 list is THA ABSOLUTE BOMB!! It's that great it makes up for anything and everything else. Don't bother coming here to drink anything else. The place could be dirty for all I care (it isn't), as long as you have a Grand Canyon you're having 5 's!!! ","  The drinks here are great since they're freshly brewed and you can taste the tea, but the girl working had to hustle to get all drinks made and take the orders at the same time. It just takes so long since there are a lot of people waiting. I felt bad ordering six drinks while she already had other drinks ordered that she didn't make yet with a group of people in line behind me. It took a while for her to take my order since she's working alone and busy making previous orders. They should hire at least two people at any given time. One to take orders and another to make drinks.","The service and boba here is fantastic. Everything that they make comes out fresh and the boba here is also perfect with just the right amount of chewiness. You can always determine how sweet you want your boba here, and I have generally found that their teas are a bit lighter on the stomach than the normal milk tea. The next time you are in the mood for some boba this is a place you should definitely check out!","It's a nice place to go to. They have the green tea, it's just a bit more than # minutes. Not sure if you're in a hurry. My husband and I had the waffle milk tea and it was great. I will definitely be back. There is a lot of options for vegetarians and some of the employees are great.",0.36879432624113473,0.05755395683453237,0.15602836879432622

The filet was thinner than expected, but cooked as ordered and delicious. The cervichi appetizer was also fabulous. The service was very good, there was a slight wait to be acknowledged, but once we were, food orders were quick and staff very friendly.  The only downside was the size of my cocktail, though made with fresh ingredients and well executed, for a $9-10 drink, it was small! Four sips and gone, please serve a martini filled close to the rim!.  But, I would recommend this restaurant and will return. Menu has lots of options for all types of eaters.

Yes they're a seafood restaurant but offer other options and have a gluten free menu. They're owned under Outback Steakhouse so the food is guaranteed delicious","This restaurant is a good casual restaurant, it may not be the best restaurant in town but it's far from the worst. The food always comes out well prepared, and is made with fresh high quality ingredients, but the staff can be a bit inattentive. The prices are also a little high here which can be a bit annoying when the service is not that great. If you feel like stopping by you should visit during happy hour when they have some half priced drinks and appetizers so you can get some better value for your money.","They have a great selection of sushi, and the drinks are always delicious.

Now they have live music on Friday nights and it's just a nice friendly low key neighborhood spot. Give it a try! ,"  Disclaimer - we went on a Monday night (birthday dinner), which violates my rules of sushi in Phoenix (don't go on Mondays)

We got a nice assortment of nigiri and maki.  The nigiri was pretty good, and they had some pretty interesting maki, too!  The presentations are very nice.

Also, for appetizers...Ninja Tears - how can you not?  (JalapeÃ±o popper type things - tasty!)

Some of the folks at the table ordered ramen, etc. too.

Very nice, and we'll have to try it again on a weekend sometime soon  ","  Blue Sushi is fantastic. I used to eat at Pure... not anymore.

"," Nothing special here. Daughter and I both had the 6 piece nigiri combo for $20. We stopped by after her volleyball game since the yelp reviews were good and we were close by. The rice fell apart under the nigiri pieces. The fish slices were slim and the quality was the same as Teharu(cheap and easy). The spicy tuna roll that came with the combo was bland and smushy. 40$ later, I'd rather have spent my sushi bucks elsewhere. Plus sides: clean, nice interior, patio. Service was typical.

She suggested a winterberry cocktail which was amazing considering I don't drink cocktails. It was made with Tito's vodka and fresh juice, none of that premade mixer crap.

Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees.

Spicy lobster on a bed of fideo with baby leeks, artichokes and fennel.  The scallops were so tender just warmed through. "," Amazing!  If you are local and haven't noticed, many properties like MGM have spring/summer tasting menus that are perfect for a nice night out.  They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3-4 course menu.  One of our fav meals so far still, and we've been here 6 years. ","  For an overpriced Vegas restaurant, this one isn't bad.  Great seafood platter, good scallops, excellent scalloped potatoes, and they threw in some more potatoes since we ordered so much stuff.  "," Dinner # 2 of last week's vegas trip.  

 I wasn't so hot on the space, as I felt like I could have been eating in a chain restaurant.

There was also zero talent in the place.  For Vegas, even during a guy-dominated convention, that is simply inexcusable (and don't forget that the AVNers were showing up around then). "," My friends and I stayed at MGM last week. After hitting a straight flush in three card poker I thought I'd take the guys out to a solid dinner. For an appetizer we ordered the king crab legs, which were nice and fresh and provided just enough for 3-4 of us to sample a couple legs.  I ordered the salmon and had it cooked medium.  Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I believe the others ordered scallops, steak, and pasta.  Definitely worth checking out if you win some money at the casino, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere considering the steep price for the good, but not excellent food.","This place will leave you with very satisfied.  Definitely one of the best seafood joints in Vegas.  They have a very large menu to choose from and it includes things like oysters, lobster, crabs, pretty much anything you could want as far as seafood.  They even mix in steak and chicken to some of the meals.  I was very impressed.",I was surprised with the fact that they are very good. My wife and I were here for lunch and dinner. We have been to this place to be a few times. The lobster was also delicious. Not sure why I wasn't in a hurry.

Here's a summary of Rosemary's:
fine dining that's not on the strip
excellent service
high but not extravagant prices
delicious food

One star off for the decor inside - a drop ceiling when people are spending $100/head??? 

*note: $75/person no show fee on weekend reservations! ","  Rosemary's is a great little restaurant. I have been there many times and it's always good. It is more of a fine dining place without the expense. I had a fantastic butternut squash soup with pepitas. My husband loved the sweetbreads (the brain kind, not the bread kind). The menu has something for everyone, whether they're picky or adventurous. I have never a had a bad meal here. And by eating there you support local business which is always a good thing.  ","  They're a bit off the strip, but not a far cab ride away.

Haven't been back to Vegas recently, but still remember that this place is amazing. The service is blow-your-mind adorable. The wait staff is incredible and they're such sweethearts. Eventhough I found their lamb very ""lamb-ie"" (which ""if it tastes that way, then the chef wanted it that way,"" ), I was still so impressed with everything else that it didn't even matter. 

Rosemary's is one of my FAVORITE restaurants ever.  ","  I have been going to Rosemary's for years. I have even been there for winemaker dinners. Rosemary's is the kind of place you should go to once a year or so. I really can't describe this place. Honestly, every high end restaurant I go into, I compare to this place. The location will throw you off. It is WAY off the strip. Which is great because you don't get the crazy bachelor/bachlorette party's.

This is very much a local place. It is reputation is on word of mouth. I always say it is the place you take your secretary to if you don't want your wife to know. lol  "," Sad News.... 

Looking forward to my second visit here since May of 2010....

I called today for reservations and was told they closed for good.

Very sad... awesome place! ","  Best restaurant I have ever eaten at.  Not the best location, but inside is great.  Service is wonderful.  The food is better than anything I have had on the strip.  "," I'm a fan.

I've been there perhaps 10 times?  Never had a bad dinner.

Always with great service, consistent food quality.

One criticism would be that their menu is pretty...ehh...unchanging.

I think it's almost the same stuff all the time.  It does get a little old and although having your staples menu is good, it needs change. "," go for lunch...good deal for $23!
the shrimp dish was aite.
the mahimahi is a must!
and the pecan pie was heaven!

service was top notch...

don't think could come for dinner...quite expensive!
nicely decorated!
really loved the bathrooms, very cute!","If you're in Vegas and want to head off the strip for some great food Rosemary's is a great place to check out.

If you close between lunch and dinner you should advertise it like sushi places do. Absolutely ridiculous and absurd. ", Super friendly owner originally from the East Coast. Food was a perfect mixture of salty sweet and spicy with a special hot sauce that was kept behind the counter.,"The staff here is extremely friendly and always make their restaurant feel just like home.

105,4M09MJwxRx8utAgEntFVrQ,"Went here recently for a happy hour. Much like other reviews state, this is an average bar/restaurant with average food and drink. I had the bruschetta to eat and it was a huge filling portion. It was OK. Nothing extraordinary to write about.  ", Simple bar and grill with a simple menu. I recommend the salmon sliders and the tater tots. , One hour wait for mediocre food.  But at least the place pumps uber loud music so everyone had to scream to be heard. ," Great place to watch games.  Had about five tvs.  The best thing at bar louie is there 4-7pm weekday happy hour.  I wish they offered a late night happy hour also.
The drinks on regular menu as well as food is overpriced for the quality.  The chicken nachos were stale.  The fatheads bumble berry small was over 6$.  So i'd probably only go here for happy hour. "," The bar area was packed on a friday evening and I met a group of about 12 girls for a bday celebration.  The waitress was sooooo slow and never checked on us and messed up our drink order repeatedly.  We would have to actually go and look for her when we needed something.  We ordered about 7 apps for the table and although they were good, it did not make up for the lackluster service.  If your in for drinks and people watching then its ok but wouldn`t go out of my way to come here again. ", Went for lunch today on my lunch break with some work friends. It took them 40 mins for them to get our food. During this time we asked for it to get our food in boxes-because at this point it took 80% of our break to even get the food. Not once did our server apologize for the ridiculous wait or even let us know what was going on in the kitchen. Keep in mind we ordered very basic menu items.  Once the food finally came out it was mediocre at best. Never going back-especially for lunch. ," This place is hit or miss. The food, when it's timely and correct, is pretty great. Good drinks too. But on more than one occasion, the service has been terrible. We actually had a serve get fired in the middle of serving us! Recommend that you sit at the bar and order drinks. It you're determined to eat, make sure it's not when they are crowded!

**Update**
I can't make this up. Went to Bar Louie for brunch on 9/10. The cook messed up our order of omelettes TWICE!!!! And the coffee was cold. I am done with this location. "," I've given this place several chances before giving up completely. We always sit at the bar, and the bartenders literally ignore us. There's no way you don't see me and my guests sitting, without drinks. And it's never super busy when we have gone in! Your bartenders need to learn to at least acknowledge - a very basic customer service trait. When you finally do revive a drink, it sits empty forever! I spent years tending bar and would never treat guests this way. 

Ps - had a group of 8 girlfriends wanting to go tonight and I warned them not to because your service is horrendous. They went to Cheesecake instead.",The staff here are slow and at times ignore the customers. The food and drinks are nothing to write home about and are pretty over priced. The wait times are long for meals and the food is often over cooked or even stale. It even takes a ridiculous amount of time to get drink refills.,I had the best tacos and the fries were good. This place is amazing. It's a great place to go to relax. A bit pricey for the quality of the food. They have a nice patio.

I never find myself saying ""let's go for dinner,"" but definitely, ""let's meet there."" Other restaurants - the Grind is nearby - have menus to brag about. But Kitchen 56 has an open feel, with appreciable curiosities on the walls, and the service has been uniformly engaging.

The bartenders drink on the job and it just seems way to pricey for the type of food and service that you get out of this place. ," Kitchen 56 is a great place to stop in during lunch or happy hour. We've had virtually every thing on the menu and the food is always great. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area and will periodically host live music. The restaurant also has a wonderful history. Their downsides are that they redid the menu last year and a lot of our favorites are no longer there, service has been lacking a little lately and they raised their prices (they would've had more stars if it weren't for these things). I guess restaurants think this is something they should automatically do when they are in the Arcadia area. "," Probably the 90th time I've been here, but I can't say enough good things about it.

Just a great place with great food and drinks, and super friendly people. ","  Food Ok. Subpar service. Found out later that the 'waiter' was the General Manager. Waited over half. An hr for the food, and even later for the check. I. hope this guy doesn't try to cook. He would just drop stuff and leave, like a fly landing on the table, then taking off before you could swat it.

*Waxing: Both Kim and Thuy are excellent and provide useful advice throughout the process... I won't say they make it painless but they make it as pleasant as waxing can be! And the place is very clean. I won't go anywhere else for my waxing!

Kim is also amazing for manicures, I had the gel nails done a few months ago and everyone at work kept asking me where I had them done!  ","  They do not do fake nails, of any kind. So if you need a fill don't bother. The website is deceiving, it allows you to pick the option of a gel set. I picked that option, and then good thing that I called before I went to ask the price or I would have gone all the way there for nothing! take that option off your website! apparently its been over a year since you offered gel nails!

Starting coming here to get my waxing done by Thuy, she is very professional and gentle.

Overall, I highly recommend this place. 
Its clean, workers are professional and the prices are acceptable! Much cheaper then some over-hyped downtown places with less professional people","The staff are sometimes in a rush and therefore are not always careful - cutting cuticles too short and not providing a very relaxing experience.

I ordered pig feet (i know, sounds scary) noodle soup.  I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.

The beef stew noodle is so perfect. Not too salty. Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter.

The first time I came here my mom and I shared the beef noodle soup and the won ton soup. Both were so amazing with lots of fresh cilantro and green onion!

The brisket was not tender and juicy, I had to work to tear into it with my teeth. Ribs were ok, I prefer it to be more easily detachable from the bone. Mac n cheese was very very meh, I'd rather eat boxed Kraft. Collard greens were good.  ", Love this place! the food was sooo good! especially the all you can eat fish fry on Fridays! ," I am so disappointed in this place. I have ordered from here many, many times and have had nothing but great service. Food was really good, on-time, etc. Tonight, I ordered and after 2 hours of waiting found out the Grubhub driver has been sitting there waiting for 90 minutes and continually being told ""it's coming..."" 90 MINUTES!!!  I called directly and spoke to the manager who had nothing to say other than ""what do you want me to do?"" I'm going to stop typing right now because I am incredibly disgusted and angry and don't want to write anything ugly. To Stacy's management directly... please get it together, you have a great product but bad service always outweighs good product. "," The service was very friendly & inviting. We were greeted upon entering and sat ourselves.  My friend & I both ordered 2 meat combo plates with mac & cheese as the side.  The brisket, hot links and ribs were delicious and the sauce was excellent. Only reason for four star rating is because the mac and cheese was a bit plain & they were out of collard greens. A good amount of food, I even had left overs. ","  Best BBQ in Arizona they actually smoke there meat not like all these other places you cant boil meat and call it BBQ.The food is amazing the staff is great!!!
Great food Great people  ", My husband and I have been to this place two weekends in a row. Not only for the amazing food but the customer service is great. Michelle is a breath of fresh air. Her upbeat attitude and contagious smile is very pleasant. She is the definition of great customer service. We've tried every meat that is on the menu and have not been unsatisfied. Highly recommend the pampered pig sandwich. It offers all the meats placed perfectly on a toasted bun with a side of barbecue sauce and is very fulfilling. We will continue to visit this establishment for the good food and great customer service. Five stars for sure! , I ordered food from them through Grub hub and the food came hot and on time. But they brought me a 3 piece chicken dinner when I order the fish dinner. I called Grub hub who stated the restaurant was sorry and they will credit me back 15.45 to my debit card I have never received that credit yet. To top it off my daughter wanted the Brisket combo we opened the box to Burned bun and all fatty brisket meat and a soggy burned bottom bun. I never received any refund from that. But Stacy's pampered pig.. I will be reporting you to the BBB for shady business. Plus people the Macaroni and cheese was nasty..... , Really just nothing nice to say here. I paid for my meal and left it there- no input from me could ever fix all the misses here.,"Really tasty BBQ food here. Service was excellent and food comes out hot and cooked. No waiting around, other than waiting for the food that is. Food amount is pretty big so there were leftovers for next time, which is awesome. They have some promotions like all you can eat Fridays, with certain foods. They also deliver so that is useful if you need it. Really authentic BBQ right here.",The meat was fresh and the food was very good. I love this place. Not sure why they have a variety of meat. We had the stuffed chicken sandwich and it was amazing.

The chicken is basic charbroiled, some times overcooked & dry, averagely seasoned, and portions are ok. 

Sirloin is adequate, plays it safe with the amount of marinade & spice. But at least its decently quality & tender meat. 

Beans are average beans & they fill their role as a side item just fine. 
The salsa is terrible mashed tomatoes. 

Service is lacking, slow, and cash only is annoying.  "," Nice simple Mexican food at a great price, love the charbroiled steak and the beans so flavorful with out a lot of stuff added. Called my order in but when I walked inside the smell was so good I had to tell them to make mine to eat in. Next time I will try the combo cause the beef was so tasty I know that charbroiled chicken will be just a good if not better.

The smell from the restaurant street were delicious and we couldn't wait to taste it! The best beef and chicken you'll find in Phoenix! And it's only 15 minutes away from the airport! For sure, I will recommend it! ","  To my homesick Indianz from Arizona, if you want home cooked food (beef, beans, tortillas) this is THE PLACE.  Tri-tip grilled on actual mesquite, tortillas that taste as close to homemade as possible, and they will actually grill jalapenos for you.  And the beans, oh the beans, just like Moms.  Eat here, you will be happy.

The food here is like what you'd get at a typical taco stand in Nogales, but without the dysentery.

The chicken and beef are equally tasty, but I tend to favor the beef because it's boneless and less work trying to get it all into the tortillas.  ","  One of the best deals and delicious beef and chicken combinations out there. It is a whole in the wall and just a gem. I will totally cater with a tray of this stuff, but may end up hoarding it to myself.",Mexican food that reminds me of what my mom used to make. It is fresh and high quality but simple and not overly complicated. The chicken is by far their specialty here and if you stop by I recommend trying it.

But I just can't get down with this place after trying it a couple times. 
The sushi is cut very thickly and has a very bland taste. Which I guess is better than a fishy taste, but it's just not good on the palate. Maybe it's the distance the fish has to travel. But I've been to a couple other sushi places in Ohio and they were a lot better. 
It's probably in part the sushi chef's knife skills. It seems like it's trying hard to be cool. It misses the mark for me. ","  In town for a business meeting and wanted sushi.  A quick walk from the hotel.  It was a quite Thursday night so I practically had the place to myself.  The choices were plenty and when I asked if they could make a Christmas Tree roll, the chef did not hesitate.  It was very good.  I enjoyed the Rainbow roll also.  The waitress was very helpful in  suggesting some of Sushi Rock's special rolls.  Definetly will visit when I am in town again.

My work colleague had his food come out literally 20 minutes after everyone else had already finished their meal. To top it off, most of the dishes were mediocre at best, especially the sushi, which had generous portions but was not good enough to justify the price.  The filet mignon was good however. "," What can I say....its sushi. They've been around for years. Weds you need a reservation for half priced sushi night. A few of my favorites are the Big Mouth (spicy), Spider (soft shell crab) and Caterpillar.  Sounds funky but they are the big rolls.  Plus they have my all time favorite dish....Kani Su (spelling?) its a bit of crab wrapped in a peeled cucumber and soaking in a light vinegar type.  Very light and I think I could eat 5 appetizers of these things. ", I highly recommend the volcano roll or the dragon roll but avoid 1/2 off night unless you want to wait forever and only get the cheap items.,Stopped by this place because I was in the city and wanted to try out some sushi. The atmosphere here is very conforming. They have great friendly service and were very quick getting my food out to me. It was a little costly but that is usually to be expected at sushi places.,It's a bit pricey but I'm glad I'm in the mood for the service. We got a sushi roll and it was good. The sushi was good.

No, it's really not possible. So much dessert goodness!

I always stop and stare at the glass case and contemplate what I am craving the most. And all of the desserts look so pretty and well put together.

But, in the end, 98% of the time, I just go for the gelato. And it is some really great gelato. Hint: Go for two scoops and choose two different flavors that compliment each other.

My fiancÃ© and I will come back here again.
Friendly and helpful staff makes it very comfortable to choose the right dish for your taste buds.  ","  Two words: THE MADDIE. This grilled cheese is everything. I'm pretty much a connoisseur of cheese sandwiches and I can tell you that Z Cafe's rendition is a winner lol. I come here regularly for lunch since my job is close and they're always well staffed at this time which makes the process of ordering and picking up very smooth. Their treats like the cookies are soooooo good, as close to fresh baked as you can get at mid afternoon during the work week. Great place to eat lunch, I just wish they'd stay open later...BLT is good also.  ","  Omg! This place is awesome. I have been for lunch and dinner several times. I have enjoyed each item I have tried. I don't eat meat so sometimes it's hard to find a good place that you can go to when you're with people who do eat meat that everyone will like, there's something for everyone there. everything is fresh, delicious I can't speak highly enough about it.  ", If you're looking for an awesome lunch spot look no further! Z Cafe is always fresh and super delicious. The Avocado BLT is my favorite. Staff is always very friendly too! , This is my second time eating at Z Cafe. I ordered the turkey bacon and avocado on sourdough with a side of fresh fruit. My husband ordered the roast beef melt on sourdough with their  potato salad. I was just as impressed with this visit as my last. Both sandwiches tasted fresh and delicious. The sides were equally tasty. I will definitely be back! ," At first I was disappointed that breakfast was over at 10:30, but I'm glad it did because I ended up getting the Alloush and it was phenomenal! Great food and great service! Everyone was friendly. ","  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, I go here literally every weekend and love all of their sandwhiches. Their sides are all homemade and are very delicious (especially the potatoe salad). The staff is very friendly and the owners are always there greeting people. Can't say enough great things about Zcafe, best sandwhich place in town!  ","  I have not found a better place for a sandwich yet.  The turkey bacon avocado is so good that I think about ordering it the next day while eating it for lunch.  The meat is Boar's Head- awesome.  The breads are amazing, the sauces are delicious and the side dishes are incredible! There isnt a single thing I have ordered that I didn't like.  They don't deliever, but it is worth the drive I assure you.  If you are hungry, go there.  Right now.  Seriously, stop reading and go to Z-Cafe.  Order the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Ciabatta.  Thank me later =)","I'd like to note that breakfast does end earlier than most places. Around 10:30 AM. So lunch kind of starts early, but it doesn't disappoint. They have delicious sandwiches and sweet foods to try. The BLT is noteworthy. Definitely a good place to check out. They use fresh ingredients too.",My friend ordered the fries and it was amazing.

Sometimes it is the little things in life that can Make You Happy- All it took was a Perfect Cheese Steak to Cheer Me Up, not to mention seeing a Friend Again - Thanks again Sam,, It wouldn't be the same without You  ","  Wow after all the hype about what a great place I was really disappointed.  If this is a franchised operation than the quality control is really lacking.  Our first visit to Capriotti's and with so many other quality places I doubt if they will get us as repeat customers.  Well, here it is.  We ordered the Bobbie and the Capastrami shared it.  Both had cold bread in fact we got the impression that both sandwiches had been pre made and put in a refrigerator because the insides were also cold.  No taste at all in either.  For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits.  Will not return  ","  This place is always good, I think the owner actually made my sandwich last time I was there , owner or manager, anyway it was superb! quite flavorful, even the next day it tasted just as good. Grab a Capistrami you can't go wrong, until next time Cappie's , be well.  ","  one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...

In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go.  "," #1 in Vegas for a reason.  Everyone has their favs.... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush...  Mine is definitely the Bobby.  In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich... yeah, exactly. "," Worst service I have seen at a capriotti's. Ordered a sandwich, watched the guy write it down and 25 minutes later the same person asked what I wanted when I reminded him of my sandwich, he only said he can't remember where the order went. I watched 4 people come in after me order, one person the same sandwich just a different size then me get their food, pay and leave. I will not be coming back to the location ever again. Looks like I will be going to firehouse for now on! "," Stopped in for a sandwich on the way to the park.  Next day I notice the charge has had a $2 tip added to it that I did not authorize.  ( I left a cash tip in the beer money jar)

I called Corporate and got nowhere because this is a franchise store.  At that point I gave up because as much as I like their sandwiches I am never going back. ", Don't bother calling in an order. If they tell you a time it will be off by at least thirty minutes. Terrible service. Great food tho.,I had heard a lot about this place before and so now that I was finally back in Vegas I decided to check it out. They know how to do sandwiches right and I would say this is probably the best Philly cheese steak that you can get on this side of the country. The place has bar like seating so it's a very casual experience but still an enjoyable one.,I would recommend this place. If you're in the mood for a place to go for a quick bite. They are all great.

The service is always good. The steak was good, although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse. I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum!  ","  Hadn't been there in several years and after this visit I remember why, I don't like onions or shallots in my macaroni and cheese. The food is good but not worth the price just a very disappointing experience and I probably won't go back  ","  My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary (literally every year we have been married). The service is exceptional and the food quality is top-notch. Furthermore, the happy hour is one of the best in the Valley. In addition to excellent drinks, they offer free prime filet steak sandwiches. I highly recommend this place for celebrations or a nice dinner out.  ","  I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there.  ","  Very good steak house.  Steaks are high quality and the service was very professional.  Attentive, but not hovering.  Classic menus and atmosphere for this kind of restaurant. No surprises. A solid option, but not a clear favorite compared to other restaurants in this category.  ", Had a wonderful experience here last night for restaurant week. Had the filet... Which was amazing and cooked perfectly with their yummy mashed potatoes and veggies. The bottle of red wine they offered for an additional $20 paired perfectly with the dinner. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back! ,"  The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood, which is good, which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious.  Its good to know that you can get top rate seafood in Phoenix.  Bacon wrapped scallops were very good, and I sacrificied a full steak (opting for the filet medallion) to try the scallops.  I asked for medium rare steak, but maybe shouldve asked for rare...my cousin had the ribeye and could not have been any happier than he was :)  

yum for fancy steak houses.  
Its an ultra romantic place to, fyi.

Really enjoyed my filet and lobster.",The steak is the must have dish at this restaurant. One small problem with the steak is that you want to order it cooked less than you would at a normal restaurant. They have the habit of going a bit over on the steak. The drinks are excellent and the stuffed mushrooms as appetizers were amazing. This is a classy place that is also romantic. The staff pays good attention to you here.,The steak tartare was great.

We sat at the bar, with maybe 10 customers in the whole restaurant and a good amount of servers. About 10 min to be asked if I wanted a drink. When the bill came. We promptly paid it and waited forever for the bartender to finish arraigning bottles and putzing around before finally taking out payment. ","  Honesty, nothing special about the burgers. I was expecting a burger experience.  All I got was an average patty with decent topping. Actually the patty wasn't great. Didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.

A good sized bar to start at while waiting to be seated.  A great beer selection, especially the bottled beer.  Went on a Saturday night and they were out of a couple draft beer selections.  I could understand a random night during the week but not sure what the excuse is for a Saturday.  They also didn't bring out the appetizer until after we received our food.  The food is good though and the service staff appeared to be solid.","This place has the best burgers, period. Not only that but they have so many different choices as far as what kind of burger you want, its insane. The also have some amazing non burger choices too if your in the mood.

Tons of protein and veggie choices and sauces too.  On to the grill and a few minutes later we were chowing!  ","  This is some of the most interesting and delicious food I've had in a LONG time. You get seated, then go up and load up your bowl. Many different meat choices, lots of veggies, and some very tasty sauces. Your food is cooked on a big grill, and normally comes out very quickly. The staff is always very nice to me. Will be coming back soon!  ","  Great selection of fresh meats and vegi's - sauces are to die for; reasonably priced and kids love it.    Watch out for coupons, they have them often.  "," Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken. ", This place should be great.  It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run.  The service is sporadic and the erratic.   The proteins in the food bar were frozen.  The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away.   We got our appetizer after our entree. ," This was a fun place to eat,  you can build your own bowl (like a typical mongolian restaurant) and they have an unlimited option for $4 more which is great for trying different creations.  One thing i really liked was the ""starch""  options. They offer noodles and rice,  but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element. Very reasonably priced. ", So far the best experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my entire life. I'm from India and moved to San Francisco in 2009 and I'm visiting family in charlotte. I believe our server name was BILL and he was very nice and polite and friendly. I haven't experienced that in many places. I felt so comfortable and welcoming. And of course the food was awesome I was kind of frustrated with the process but man the food came out great. Thanks for this great experience. You guys need to bring this to San Francisco!! And not to mention the free refills on the drinks and you can choose different drinks as well. , Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9.99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook. Good thing I had a coupon so I was able to shave a little off the total. I think one visit is good enough for me.,"They have an interesting and wide selection of food to choose from, which is really neat. However, the quality of the food is only okay, and I'm not sure I can recommend going here. Some of the food chews weird and is a bit pricey for what you get",We were here for lunch and we had the lasagna and the stuffed pepper chicken. I don't think it's more than what you get. We have a huge variety of food and drinks. But the price is very reasonable. The service is always great. I was a fan of the red curry and my friend and I went to this place.,0.3716814159292035,0.0900900900900901,0.17699115044247787

That day, I had an amazing Aji - Sashimi that almost made me forget that I was in the middle of the desert. I don't know how they do it, but everything I tasted was fresh! I'd definitely repeat.  ","  Great Food and AMAZING customer service. These are the must have : Pork Cheek, Pork Belly, Beef Tounge and Saba Shio. If you still have room, they serve the best sushi in town as well.  ","  Excellent food, excellent variety, excellent prices!  Our group of four enjoyed the experience of trying all sorts of new foods and combinations with prices reasonable enough to get adventurous.  The maguro carpaccio and koko beef (I think that's the name) are DO NOT MISS items, but skip the bleu cheese potato salad, very bland.
Service wasn't fast, but was attentive and accommodating.  We will be going back!  "," Great tapas kirin draft pitcher $10, happy hour menu is super lit. Oh my god those pork cheeks tapas, get it just salted. Rumy and Bryan top notch servers for real. Spicy tuna bowl. Mouth water AF get it with the gyoza sauce telling you guys. If you sit at the bar you can watch the chefs put in work. And my dudes clientele here a lot of girls haha ","  I found Kyara since it was closer to work than Naked Fish, and was immediately sold on the concept of Japanese tapas.  They have the roppongi roll I'm addicted to, and a very extensive menu. We got their pork kimchi stir fry, unagi kabayaki, tori kara age, a couple rolls, and they have a maccha waffle.  I shouldn't be eating this, but I did, and I regret nothing! It's a maccha waffle with vanilla ice cream and strawberry sorbet, served with syrup and butter.  This is one of the best desserts I've ever had anywhere at anytime.  ","  This place is great! Such a varied selection of robata items and Japanese style tapas! 

It's open late which is perfect for me but they don't let you do Togo orders in the evening which is a bummer.  ", I've been here before...good food ...but the consistency needs improvement...service was mediocre...still like this place cause it is close to the house...maybe Jose's bandana is covering his eyes when he's cooking!! ," Worst 60.00 I've ever spent. 

Ridiculous wait time for food. 30 mins wait for deep fried oysters?! 

Mediocre food, over priced

195,87YsVbCN_kfzheY79Fzjkg,Great experience! Went cake tasting for our wedding and Jessica was a huge help!! She brought out the tastings for us after giving us time to look through their amazing book. She explained every cake and filling and had great recommendations for mixing the fillings. The champagne cake with cream cheese filling was amazing!! Chose our cake and design within an hour. Great service and knowledge. Thank you Jessica! ," Great sevice. Great communication. You guys gave me exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Kyra for your great correspondence via email and understanding my needs. You guys are amazing. My cake was delivered 30 min before the scheduled time on the strip which is amazing because of all the traffic.

I will definitely be back when I'm in town. ","  Employees are nice and helpful. Now,  the cake that I got was super dry and tasteless. How can you mess up a cake that is supposed to be your specialty?  Even my kids did not eat it.  I am not going back.  ","  Awesome tiramisu cake, taste so good. Been a customer for some time and will return again and again. Greaaaaat place.  ","  In Vegas with a friend and our theme for the week was food - what a great decision to include Pastry Palace in our selection! We were met with wonderfully friendly service and got a box of deliciousness to go. I totally recommend the fruit tart, creme brÃ»lÃ©e, and tiramisu - all eaten while cuddled up under the hotel comforter with a cup of coffee - amazing!  "," Jessica was awesome.  I was a little pushy for the quote because I was in a time crunch and had a very particular idea.  We spoke,  I emailed her my idea and budget and we worked out what I needed for a reasonable price.   I NEEDED fresh carrot cake for a birthday and it exceeded my expectations.  I was beautiful but I was still nervous about the taste.   EVERYONE atvthe party who likes carrot cake,  loved it.  The only reason I gave it a 4, was the decor at the bottom didn't stay tight and there was a silver smudge right on top next to the M.

196,8DPZWbP6gKaBsGoAFQkSaA,"This is our second visit to this establishment and our server, Jarred, was excellent. We had the luncheon menu and were suitably impressed. I gave the first review of this restaurant and came away very satisfied and knowing that I will return. The second visit did not disappoint. The ambience, employees, menu and quality of the food is all above par and worthy of your visitation.  ", Late night went for apps. Calamari and meat balls had been recommended by server ...tried both. Both good. Service was friendly and good. ," Great patio, great menu, and absolutely great servers too.
Jamie was absolutely amazing he's a 5 star server! ", Awesome place I love the hot wings however it would be better if there were more choices for wings I thinks I would be happier and a lot of other people would be. ," The food is more like 3* not bad for a fancy bar but nothing that makes you want to come back. But the place is noisy, even at 1:30pm with distorted music in the background. The kicker though is that for 7 of us we were told they would automatically apply 18% gratuity... So the server could not care less. We had to ask for waters, for drink refills and overall she was as unfriendly as it gets. Why bother earning your tip if you know you are getting 18% no matter what. So not really recommended. ","  Awesome menu, great atmosphere and tremendous service....

Lively crowd and overall very FUN and ENERGETIC environment 

Best restaurant in Oakville for sure  "," Good Ambience. Young vibe. Helpful Staff. Food was Good. Expensive place. 
I ordered I don't remember the exact name of the dish but it was a Chicken curry which comes with some rice which was good. They have a decent cocktail menu. We were a group of 6 people and out of all the cocktails/wines that we ordered, the biggest serving was of ""yacht club"" cocktail. So, If you want a value for money, generous quantity cocktail, order the vodka based ""yacht club"" cocktail. ", A regular here for drinks and small bites. It's always packed here so it has great energy. The food is pretty good including the calamari and the meat ball app. The burgers are also very good!,"Great place with overall great vibe and atmosphere. The menu is also great.

For the price you pay you can feed a lot of people with plently left over for the next day.There always coupons available and you always get something free when you spend a certain amount.Now I'm hungry.. , It's pretty hard to find a Chinese restaurant that's decent enough to just grab and go. This place is perfect for that. The food is pretty good and I like that the cooks wear hats! They give pretty good portions too. , This place was absolutely fantastic!!! We are big-time yelpers and neither one of us are the huge fans of Chinese food both very picky when it comes to it!!! With that said we locate at this place with her the less than a couple of miles from our house from the time we walked in super friendly service everything we ordered was absolutely fantastic!!! From the war wonton soup the honey walnut shrimp Hong Kong noodles as well as their egg rolls absolutely to die for!!!! Their portions are huge and the leftovers are even better the next day!!! Would definitely try delivery next time as the reviews are great on it and I believe everything would come piping hot as well as top-quality ,"  First time trying this place...

It's clean, the service was really good, and the menu was typical. 

I ordered the chicken lo mein and combination fried rice. 

The food was full of flavor, and I'm glad I have a new option when I want Chinese. 

Check it out people.  ", We have had two deliveries and both were perfect. This is now who we call for Chinese food.
