       "\"The sesame bread is amazing. The sandwich was huge but I ended up eating the whole thing. Very very good! </DOC>  Delicious. Cheap. Friendly. Quick (if you want it to be!). What more could you ask for? \\nThe atmosphere at McGurkee's is reminiscent of an old town go-to with the friendliest staff in the valley. The sandwiches are inexpensive and are, in my opinion, the best Italian subs in AZ. Get the Sicilian if you want to know what a real sub tastes like.\\n\\nOverall, go to McGurkee's. It'd be impossible to leave disappointed.  </DOC> Been going here since the late 80s. A family run establishment, creating some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.\\n\\nFrom the toasted sesame rolls to the pickles and peppers, it's all about the details. My personal favorite is the Super Sicilian. Incredible!\\n\\nNotable: The offer beer </DOC> just fell into this place today and WOW what a gem  GREAT sandwiches  I had the super sicilian and it was fantastic!  great meats  great toasted bread  great cheese and great dressing  wish I had found this place sooner  I will be back to try their pizza which is only served at dinner.  friendly staff and great service   one of only a few great sandwich shops I have found in Phoenix    a MUST TRY! </DOC>  The food was okay. I'd like to give them more stars, but I could get the same quality at a quiznos or subway. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for a sandwich here, but if your in the area it's acceptable.  </DOC>  Awesome sandwiches best bread, had the Pastrami Sandwich and it was a great experience with the homemade bread, pastrami meat and the condiments included, would not change a thing.\\n\\nDid I mention the bread? It is toasted and has a great taste and firm consistency.\\n\\nThe restaurant is an older quaint building which is nice and fun. better \\n\\nOne of the best sandwiches in town.  </DOC>  There is nothing not to like about this place, great sandwiches and a friendly staff of people working behind the counter.  Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did.  </DOC>  It's been a while since I've been in this place, and I figured it was time for a good sammie. I've had a few of their sandwiches in the past, but today I got the Athenian chicken sandwich. The sautÃ©ed onions and feta cheese adds a nice flavor to it. I would recommend this place if you are in the area or for someone who wants to venture out from their usual sandwich joint.\""

The best product is what I want and the budtenders at Essence-The Strip are the best at it!! </DOC>  Candance and shehelle were amazing, they helped me find what I was looking for! They were very helpful and showed me everything!  </DOC> Sidney, you were very friendly and knowledgable with everything you showed me... Thank you! (:\\nI tried Girl Scout cookies, it isn't sticky like I'm used to but it's not dried out which has been a first for me in Vegas dispensaries so you guys are number 1 in my book. I'll definitely be back for sure! Thanks guys! :D </DOC>  I liked this club a lot. I came from California for EDC and we came across this club in our way to our hotel. Me and my friend decided to go in and look around. \\n\\nAtmosphere was amazing! The staff was so nice, was talking to us. They knew the product and could tell us what bud was good or how it will react. Most clubs in California wouldn't be able to tell us all their products. \\n\\nI really liked this club and we will be coming back!  </DOC> Essence is the best dispensary in Las Vegas. Really nice atmosphere & great product for a great price. Staff is the friendliest ! Alex @ this location is very helpful ! </DOC> Yet again the bud is dry when can we get some sticky icky damn man lol but it was fire </DOC>  A few days ago I received my approval letter  and based on reviews I knew exactly knew where to go. Che and Brian exceeded my expectations! Che was very friendly and welcoming. And Brian was very patient with me. I had no idea what I was going to get and he really helped me pick some flowers that definitely helped me get medicated the way I wanted to. And I was shocked about the prices! And they always have specials! And the staff treated me like a friend, not just a customer. I'll definitely be back again!\""

       "'Regular customer for the last year. I get what is really a \"trim\" every 2.5 weeks. Appointment is typically 15 minutes or less. For the first time in a year, missed an appointment. Was offered to re-schedule but was told that I\\'d be charged for the full appointment as a \"no-show\" fee. So much for customer loyalty. Too bad they\\'re so willing to walk away from a loyal, regular client over $30. </DOC> Always a great experience.  The staff and owners care about the customer and the service they provide is top notch.  The new design and decor look great! </DOC>  I have been going to Gianna Christine for a number of years now and have never had anything less than a great experience. Shannelle, my stylist, does a wonderful job every time. Very helpful and skilled. The staff taking payments and answering phones are always friendly. Both my sister and mom also go there now and always get great results.  </DOC> I had an appointment booked several weeks out, and they call and cancel on me, less than an hour before my appointment time.  I understand people do get sick, but this is not the first time this has happened. They really need a more professional, accountable staff.  You\\'d think you would have know earlier...less than an hours notices.  Then, just like last time, sorry we\\'re booked straight the next month...after I\\'ve waited and they cancel on me? I do not recommend them, and will never go back.  I\\'ve always shown up, and always have tipped well, at least 20%. Too they\\'re not the most reasonable, my appointments run over $150 every time. </DOC> I come in for a trim twice a month and I am very happy with the professional courteous staff. The store front in very clean and organized and my stylist Destini is on it every time! Amazing! So glad I found this place!! </DOC>  What a great salon! This was my first time here and I am totally impressed. The girl at the front, I believe her name is Jessica, went above and beyond to get me in and then rescheduled my appointment to a sooner date so that I could have my hair done before my daughter is born. Simone\\'s book was completely full but they worked their magic and got me in. I am a very picky blonde, and Simone nailed it. She is a super talented hair stylist as well very sweet. I love my hair and cannot wait to go back. I highly recommend Gianna Christine Salon and Spa.  </DOC> I had relatives come I. From out of town and I referred them to the salon for massage and facial.  The facials were mediocre and the massages less then satisfying.  What has happened to the service of this salon. Will never refer anyone again. </DOC>  Steven S. Is my hairstylist here, he is a wonderful, intelligent, a great hairstylist.  I love this young boy.  This place is awesome clean and bright.  Highly recommended.'"
